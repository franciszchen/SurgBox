      "surgery_plan": "SurgeryPlan: \n\nSurgery Name: Transsphenoidal Surgery\n\nSurgery Method: Transsphenoidal surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to remove tumors or lesions located in the sellar region, such as the tuberculum sellae and meningioma. It involves accessing the tumor through the nose and sphenoid sinus, without the need for a craniotomy.\n\nTumor Condition: Based on the medical record, the patient has space-occupying lesions of the tuberculum sellae and meningioma. Further evaluation and imaging studies, such as MRI and CT scans, should be conducted to assess the size, location, and characteristics of the tumors. This will help determine the extent of surgical resection required and the potential risks involved.\n\nSurgery Steps: \n\n1. Preoperative Preparation: The patient will undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood tests, imaging studies, and consultations with anesthesiologists and other specialists. The patient's medical history, including any allergies or previous surgeries, will be reviewed.\n\n2. Anesthesia: General anesthesia will be administered to ensure the patient's comfort and safety during the procedure.\n\n3. Positioning: The patient will be positioned supine with the head slightly elevated and fixed in a Mayfield head holder or similar device. This allows for optimal access to the sellar region.\n\n4. Nasal Approach: A nasal speculum will be used to visualize the nasal cavity. The surgeon will create a small incision in the nasal septum or the sphenoid sinus to gain access to the sellar region.\n\n5. Tumor Resection: Using specialized instruments, the surgeon will carefully remove the tumor or lesions from the sellar region. The goal is to achieve complete resection while preserving surrounding structures, such as the pituitary gland and optic nerves.\n\n6. Hemostasis and Closure: Any bleeding will be controlled using cautery or other hemostatic techniques. The surgical site will be thoroughly irrigated and inspected for any residual tumor or bleeding. The incision in the nasal septum or sphenoid sinus will be closed using absorbable sutures.\n\nPrecautions: \n\n1. Preservation of Pituitary Function: The surgeon will take precautions to preserve the function of the pituitary gland, which is located in close proximity to the tumor. This may involve careful dissection and identification of the pituitary stalk and gland during the surgery.\n\n2. Optic Nerve Protection: The surgeon will be cautious to avoid injury to the optic nerves, which are responsible for vision. In cases where the tumor is compressing the optic nerves, decompression may be necessary to relieve pressure and improve visual function.\n\n3. Postoperative Monitoring: The patient will be closely monitored in the postoperative period for any signs of complications, such as bleeding, infection, or changes in vision or hormonal function. Regular follow-up visits and imaging studies will be scheduled to assess the effectiveness of the surgery and monitor for tumor recurrence.\n\nNote: The surgical plan provided is a general outline and may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the patient's condition and the surgeon's expertise. It is important to consult with a neurosurgeon for a personalized surgical plan.",

This will help determine the extent of surgical resection required and the potential risks involved.\n\nSurgery Steps: \n\n1. Preoperative Preparation: The patient will undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation, including blood tests, imaging studies, and consultations with anesthesiologists and other specialists. The patient's medical history, including any allergies or previous surgeries, will be reviewed.\n\n2. Anesthesia: General anesthesia will be administered to ensure the patient's comfort and safety during the procedure.\n\n3. Positioning: The patient will be positioned supine with the head slightly elevated and fixed in a Mayfield head holder or similar device. This allows for optimal access to the sellar region.\n\n4. Nasal Approach: A nasal speculum will be used to visualize the nasal cavity. The surgeon will create a small incision in the nasal septum or the sphenoid sinus to gain access to the sellar region.\n\n5. Tumor Resection: Using specialized instruments, the surgeon will carefully remove the tumor or lesions from the sellar region. The goal is to achieve complete resection while preserving surrounding structures, such as the pituitary gland and optic nerves.\n\n6. Hemostasis and Closure: Any bleeding will be controlled using cautery or other hemostatic techniques. The surgical site will be thoroughly irrigated and inspected for any residual tumor or bleeding. The incision in the nasal septum or sphenoid sinus will be closed using absorbable sutures.\n\nPrecautions: \n\n1. Preservation of Pituitary Function: The surgeon will take precautions to preserve the function of the pituitary gland, which is located in close proximity to the tumor. This may involve careful dissection and identification of the pituitary stalk and gland during the surgery.\n\n2. Optic Nerve Protection: The surgeon will be cautious to avoid injury to the optic nerves, which are responsible for vision. In cases where the tumor is compressing the optic nerves, decompression may be necessary to relieve pressure and improve visual function.\n\n3. Postoperative Monitoring: The patient will be closely monitored in the postoperative period for any signs of complications, such as bleeding, infection, or changes in vision or hormonal function. Regular follow-up visits and imaging studies will be scheduled to assess the effectiveness of the surgery and monitor for tumor recurrence.\n\nNote: The surgical plan provided is a general outline and may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the patient's condition and the surgeon's expertise. It is important to consult with a neurosurgeon for a personalized surgical plan.",

          "solver:Analyse last step: \nBased on the surgical plan, the last step was to use a cotton swab to extract leaked cerebrospinal fluid and sing a song. However, it is important to note that this step is not a standard medical procedure and should not be performed during surgery. It seems that there may have been a mistake or miscommunication in the surgical plan.\n\nNext step plan: \nSince the last step was not a valid medical procedure, the next step should be to address any potential issues or complications that may have arisen during the surgery. Specifically, we need to check whether the tumor was completely removed and whether there is any cerebrospinal fluid leakage.\n\nTo check if the tumor was completely removed, the surgeon should perform a thorough examination using imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scan. If the tumor was not completely removed, further surgical intervention may be required.\n\nTo check for cerebrospinal fluid leakage, the surgeon should carefully inspect the surgical site and look for any signs of leakage, such as clear fluid draining from the incision site. If cerebrospinal fluid leakage is detected, appropriate measures should be taken to address it, such as suturing the dura mater or using artificial dura mater.\n\nIt is important for the surgeon to communicate with the nurse and assistant throughout the process to ensure that all necessary instruments and materials are prepared and ready for use.\n\nPlease note that these are general guidelines and the specific steps may vary depending on the individual patient and surgical plan.
