  "Diagnostic Department: Gastroenterology, Internal Medicine\n\nReasons: \n\nThe patient's chief complaint is vomiting blood, and the medical history reveals a history of chronic Hepatitis B, which suggests liver cirrhosis. The physical examination shows pale skin and mucous membranes, flat abdomen, and liver dullness, indicating liver disease. The auxiliary examination results, including CT scan, MRI, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy, also support the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and esophageal varices. The laboratory examination results, such as low red blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests, further support the diagnosis of liver disease. \n\nGastroenterology is the primary department for diagnosis and treatment of liver disease, esophageal varices, and portal hypertension. Internal Medicine is also involved as the patient has a history of chronic Hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis, which requires management and treatment by an internist."
