Here is a reorganized and rewritten version of the surgery process:\n\nSurgery Process:\nAfter anesthesia, the patient was positioned supine with the head slightly tilted back, and the operating table was positioned with the head high and the feet low. The surgical field was sterilized and draped, and the nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with complex iodine and norepinephrine. Five minutes after shrinking the middle turbinate with a 1ml cotton pad, neuroendoscopic exploration of the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings was performed. The right middle turbinate was pushed laterally to facilitate the exploration. The nasal mucosa was incised from the opening of the sphenoid sinus to the choanal space, revealing the bony nasal septum, which was then drilled and polished at high speed. The ventral wall of the sphenoid sinus was opened, and the bone window was enlarged to 1.5cm. A micro-drill was used to expand the sellar floor bone window to 1.3cm. The tumor was completely resected, and the tissue was collected with forceps. The tumor cavity was curetted with various types of curettes and flushed with normal saline. No residual tumor tissue was found, and careful inspection showed no leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. Artificial dura mater was used to reconstruct the sellar floor. The nasal cavity was packed with Naxi cotton and covered with sterile dressing.\n\n**Score: B (Many inconsistencies)**\n\n**Shortcomings and Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Lack of clarity and concision**: The report should be rewritten to follow a clear and concise structure, making it easier to follow.\n2. **Missing steps**: The report lacks details on the preparation step, including patient positioning, surgical field sterilization, and nasal cavity disinfection.\n3. **Inadequate description of neuroendoscopic exploration**: The report should provide more detail on the neuroendoscopic exploration, including the use of the neuroendoscope and suction.\n4. **Insufficient description of tumor resection**: The report should provide more detail on the tumor resection, including the use of electrosurgery and curettes.\n5. **No mention of anesthesia and patient monitoring**: The report should include information on anesthesia and patient monitoring during the surgery.\n\n**Standard Surgical Procedure:**\n\nTo improve the surgery process, the following standard surgical procedure should be followed:\n\n1. Clearly document the preparation step, including patient positioning, surgical field sterilization, and nasal cavity disinfection.\n2. Provide detailed descriptions of each step, including neuroendoscopic exploration, tumor resection, and reconstruction.\n3. Include information on anesthesia and patient monitoring during the surgery.\n4. Use a clear and concise structure to make the report easy to follow.",

        "MR": "Postoperative pituitary tumor changes, the sphenoid sinus mucosa is thickened. The right side of the pituitary gland is full, with patchy slightly higher T2 and iso-T1 signals, mild enhancement, and relatively slightly low signal, 1.8×1.2×1.4 cm, the right cavernous sinus was surrounded and the left pituitary gland was evenly enhanced. The transverse diameter was 2.6 mm and the anteroposterior diameter was 2.1 mm. There was no obvious abnormality in the left cavernous sinus. There is short T1 signal in the lobe. Local mucosal thickening in the sphenoid sinus and ethmoid sinus. Compare with the old film from our hospital on 2021-08-03: the changes after transsphenoidal surgery of the pituitary gland are still visible, and the right side of the pituitary gland is slightly larger than before. Please combine it. Clinical follow-up review showed that the local mucosa of the sphenoid sinus and ethmoid sinus was thickened, which was better than before; the rest was basically the same as before. ",

The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual, and the nasal cavity and lips are disinfected with complex iodine, and the nasal cavity and lips are disinfected with norepinephrine. Five minutes after shrinking the middle turbinate with a 1ml cotton pad, perform neuroendoscopic exploration first, remove part of the right middle turbinate, and use monopolar electrosurgery to incise the nasal mucosa from the opening of the sphenoid sinus to the choanal space to reveal the bony nasal septum, which is then drilled and polished at high speed. The ventral wall of the sphenoid sinus is opened, and the bone window is enlarged to 1.5cm A micro-drill was used to expand the sellar floor bone window to 1.3cm There is no false capsule, the medial wall of the right cavernous sinus is defective, the sellar septum is intact, and the tumor is completely resected. After the tissue is collected with forceps, various types of curettes are used to carefully curette the tumor cavity in the sella and flush the tumor cavity with normal saline. No residual tumor tissue was found. Careful inspection showed no leakage of cerebrospinal fluid. Artificial dura mater was used to reconstruct the sellar floor. The nasal cavity was packed with Naxi cotton and covered with sterile dressing. The operation took 2 hours and the blood loss was about 100ml. The endotracheal tube was placed back in the anesthesia recovery room. The tumor was approximately 18×12×14mm3 and was sent for pathological examination. "
