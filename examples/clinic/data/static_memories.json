The surgical field was sterilized and draped as usual, and a frontotemporal incision was made to incise the scalp. The skin flap and muscle flap were separated through an interfascial approach and the scalp was retracted with a retractor. Drill one bone hole each at the key hole and the superior temporal line, and use a milling cutter to form a frontotemporal bone flap. After drilling the edge of the bone window, suspend the dura mater with a small needle and fine thread, and incise the dura mater about 0.5cm away from the edge of the bone window. The tension of the brain tissue is high, and the brain pressure plate lifts the bottom surface of the frontal lobe to release cerebrospinal fluid and explore the sellar area. The tumor pseudocapsule is gray-red, rich in blood supply, soft in texture, and clearly demarcated from the surrounding brain tissue. After bipolar electrocoagulation is used to cauterize and shrink the tumor, intratumoral resection is performed first, and the edges of the tumor are carefully separated to completely remove the entire tumor. Check that there is no obvious active bleeding on the wound surface. Immediately cover the wound surface with gauze and use artificial dura mater to cover the meningeal defect. A high-speed drill is used to remove the tumor-invaded part of the inner layer of the bone plate, a titanium plate is used to fix the bone flap, the scalp is sutured in layers, and the surgical incision is wet-packed with alcohol dressing. The wound where the head nail is used for fixation of the head frame is covered with sterile dressing. The operation went smoothly. The intraoperative blood loss was about 300ml, and the autologous blood (forced washing) was about 244ml. After the operation, the patient was returned to the ICU with tracheal intubation.

The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual, a coronal incision is made on the scalp, and the myocutaneous flap is separated under the galea to the supraorbital notch. After the periosteal flap is separated, it is pulled forward together with the myocutaneous flap using a skin retractor. The temporalis muscle is separated appropriately, and the No. 7 suture is tied and pulled to the outside. Drill a bone hole at the key hole on the right side, 1cm to the right of the midline, and behind the superior temporal line, and form a bone flap with a milling cutter; the front edge of the bone window is as close to the base of the forehead as possible, and the outer edge is located about 2cm below the sphenoid crest. . After applying bone wax to the edge of the bone window to suspend the dura mater, the dura mater is incised and the dural flap is turned toward the midline. The surface of the frontal lobe brain tissue is covered with gelatin sponge and brain cotton. The brain pressure plate appropriately retracts the brain tissue, slowly and fully releases the cerebrospinal fluid, and carefully separates the arachnoid tissue of the basal cistern. Dark red tumor tissue can be seen in the first space, which is closely related to the bilateral optic nerves. After carefully exposing the bilateral optic nerves, they were protected. Bipolar electrocoagulation is used to burn the tumor tissue envelope and perform intratumoral decompression. The boundary between the tumor and the bilateral optic nerves was separated along the outer capsule and protected. The frontal lobe is pulled backward, and the adhesion between the frontal base and the tumor capsule is gradually separated, and the tumor that grows forward, posteriorly and superiorly is removed from the capsule. Explore into the sella along the enlarged septal sella foramen, and use a pituitary tumor curette to remove most of the tumor tissue. After sufficient hemostasis, gauze and gelfoam were quickly applied to cover the intrasellar tumor wound, and a temporalis muscle with a diameter of approximately 1 cm was placed. Subdural indwelling drainage tubes are connected to the bag. After the dura mater is sutured continuously, it is covered with artificial closing membrane. The bone flap is fixed with a titanium plate. The scalp is sutured in layers, and the surgical incision is wetted with alcohol dressing.

This information is important for a comprehensive surgical report.\n- The report does not mention the use of any imaging techniques, such as CT or MRI, for pre-operative planning or intraoperative guidance. Including this information would provide a more complete picture of the surgical procedure.\n- The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or neuronavigation. These techniques are commonly used in neurosurgery to ensure the safety and accuracy of the procedure.\n- The report does not provide information on the post-operative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up appointments. Including this information would ensure continuity of care for the patient.\n\nOverall Grade: B",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame after anesthesia was completed.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped as usual.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised sequentially, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- Intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation were used to guide the incision of the dura mater.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal area.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep, and rapid freezing pathology indicated a high-grade glioma.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- Hemostasis was confirmed to be satisfactory.\n- The ventricle and surgical field were flushed, and a drainage tube was placed.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n- The bleeding during the operation was approximately 100ml, and no blood transfusion was performed.\n- The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on preoperative evaluation and patient selection. It is important to provide information on the patient's medical history, imaging findings, and any preoperative assessments that were performed to determine the suitability of the surgery.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical approach and technique. The report should provide more specific details on the steps taken during the surgery, such as the specific instruments used, the depth and extent of tissue dissection, and any challenges encountered.\n\n3. Limited information on intraoperative monitoring and navigation. It would be beneficial to include details on the specific monitoring modalities used, such as electrophysiological monitoring and neuronavigation, and how they were utilized during the surgery.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care and follow-up. The report should mention the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and any specific instructions given to the patient for their recovery.\n\n5. Insufficient documentation of complications and their management. It is important to document any complications that occurred during the surgery and how they were addressed, as well as any adverse events or unexpected findings.\n\n6. Incomplete information on the final outcome and prognosis. The report should provide information on the extent of tumor resection, any residual tumor, and the expected prognosis for the patient.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks sufficient detail and organization. It is important to provide a comprehensive and structured account of the surgical procedure, including preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative details, as well as any complications and their management.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical bed in a head-down position.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and drapes were applied. The nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine solution.\n- After 5 minutes of vasoconstriction using a cotton pad soaked in 1ml of adrenaline, the right middle turbinate was partially resected using a monopolar electrocautery.\n- A unipolar electrocautery was used to open the maxillary sinus from the nasal choana to the posterior nasal aperture, exposing the bony nasal septum.\n- The ethmoidal sinus was accessed by grinding the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus with a high-speed drill, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the lateral wall of the maxillary sinus was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n- The bone septum within the sphenoid sinus was removed using a microdrill, enlarging the sellar floor window to 1.3cm x 1.0cm.\n- The sellar floor dura mater and scar tissue were carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor in the right pituitary gland. The tumor had poor blood supply, clear boundaries, and no pseudocapsule. The medial wall of the cavernous sinus on the right side was defective, but the sellar septum was intact.\n- The tumor was completely resected, and tissue samples were taken for pathological examination. The tumor cavity was thoroughly scraped using various sizes of curettes.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue was found. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage was not observed.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. The nasal cavities were packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery was successful, with a total duration of 2 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n- The resected tumor measured approximately 18x12x14mm^3, and a portion of it was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Inconsistent positioning: The surgical report mentions that the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, but the standard surgical procedure requires the patient to be in the supine position with the head slightly extended. It is important to ensure accuracy and consistency in reporting the patient's position during surgery.\n\n2. Inadequate description of surgical approach: The report does not provide detailed information about the surgical approach used, such as the specific incision made or the layers of tissue dissected. It is important to include this information for a comprehensive surgical report.\n\n3. Lack of information on intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention any intraoperative monitoring techniques used, such as neuronavigation or electrophysiological monitoring. These techniques are commonly used in pituitary surgeries to ensure accurate tumor localization and preservation of critical structures. Including this information would enhance the completeness of the report.\n\n4. Insufficient details on tumor characteristics: The report does not provide specific details about the tumor, such as its consistency, vascularity, or histopathological diagnosis. These details are important for understanding the nature of the tumor and guiding further treatment decisions.\n\n5. Incomplete description of hemostasis and closure: The report does not mention the specific techniques used for hemostasis or the closure of the surgical site. Providing this information would give a more comprehensive overview of the surgical procedure.\n\n6. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report does not mention any details about postoperative care, such as the use of drains, postoperative medications, or follow-up plans. Including this information would provide a more holistic view of the patient's management after surgery.\n\nOverall, the surgical report has several inconsistencies and lacks important details. To improve the report, it is recommended to provide accurate and detailed information about the surgical approach, intraoperative monitoring, tumor characteristics, hemostasis and closure techniques, and postoperative care.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, ensuring proper exposure and aseptic conditions.\n\nThe nasal cavity and lips are disinfected using iodine cotton swabs, and the nasal mucosa is decongested using a cotton pad soaked in a solution containing 1ml of adrenaline. This helps to reduce bleeding and improve visualization during the procedure.\n\nA neuroendoscope is used to explore and expose the sellar floor from the lateral wall of the sella turcica. A microdrill is then used to enlarge the sellar opening, removing the thin bone of the sellar floor. Care is taken to avoid damage to surrounding structures.\n\nThe dura mater of the sellar floor is carefully incised using a microhook knife, and a pale yellow viscous fluid is observed to overflow from the sella turcica. A tissue forceps is used to obtain a pathological specimen for further analysis.\n\nThe cyst contents are then sequentially removed using a microcurette, ensuring complete removal of the cyst. The cyst is primarily located within the sella turcica, and no residual cyst contents are observed upon further inspection with the neuroendoscope.\n\nDuring the procedure, the diaphragma sellae is lowered into the sella turcica, and no obvious cerebrospinal fluid leakage is observed. The surgical field remains relatively dry, with no significant active bleeding or foreign body residue.\n\nThe sellar defect is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater, and the sellar floor is reconstructed using a combination of gelatin sponge and collagen surgical hemostatic material. This helps to ensure proper sealing and hemostasis.\n\nThe nasal cavity is packed with nasal tampons on both sides to prevent bleeding and provide support to the reconstructed sellar floor. The surgery is completed without any complications.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. The surgical report lacks specific details regarding the patient's pre-operative condition, such as any relevant medical history or imaging findings. It is important to include this information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the case.\n\n2. The report does not mention the use of neuronavigation or intraoperative ultrasound, which are commonly used tools in modern surgical practice. These technologies can aid in accurate tumor localization and improve surgical outcomes. It is recommended to incorporate these techniques into the surgical process.\n\n3. The report does not mention the use of electrophysiological monitoring during the procedure. This monitoring can help identify critical structures and minimize the risk of neurological deficits. It is advisable to include this monitoring in future surgeries.\n\n4. The report does not provide information on the post-operative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up instructions. It is essential to outline these aspects to ensure proper patient recovery and minimize post-operative complications.\n\n5. The report does not mention the use of any specific hemostatic agents or techniques during the procedure. It is recommended to include details on the hemostatic measures taken to ensure adequate control of bleeding.\n\n6. The report does not mention the use of any drainage system after the surgery. The placement of a drainage tube can help prevent post-operative fluid accumulation and improve patient outcomes. It is suggested to consider the use of a drainage system in future surgeries.\n\nOverall, the surgical procedure described in the report demonstrates a satisfactory approach to sellar floor reconstruction and cyst removal. However, there are areas for improvement in terms of pre-operative evaluation, intraoperative techniques, and post-operative care. By addressing these shortcomings and implementing the suggested recommendations, the surgical team can further enhance patient outcomes and surgical success.",

Rapid freezing pathology indicated a high-grade glioma.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors. The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open. Electrophysiological monitoring showed that the anterior tumor invaded the posterior limb of the internal capsule, so it was not resected.\n- After the tumor was basically removed under the microscope, intraoperative MRI was performed, which showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The peripheral wall of the residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze to enhance the hemostatic effect.\n- The systolic blood pressure increased to the entrance blood pressure, confirming satisfactory hemostasis and good brain pulse.\n- The ventricle and surgical field were flushed, and a drainage tube was placed.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater to keep the dura mater intact.\n- Titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly, followed by suturing the scalp and covering it with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely transferred back to the ward for postoperative care.\n- The bleeding during the operation was about 100ml, and no blood transfusion was performed.\n- The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of this operation and suggestions:\n\n1.

Incomplete resection of the tumor: The intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion. It is crucial to aim for complete tumor resection whenever possible to minimize the risk of recurrence. Consider using additional imaging techniques or intraoperative guidance to ensure complete resection in future surgeries.\n\n3. Lack of information on postoperative care: The surgical report does not provide sufficient information about the postoperative care provided to the patient. It is important to document the specific instructions given for pain management, wound care, and recovery to ensure optimal patient outcomes.\n\n4. Inadequate documentation of complications: The report does not mention any complications encountered during the surgery. It is essential to document any complications, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or other intraoperative complications, to facilitate appropriate management and follow-up.\n\n5. Limited information on pathological examination: The report mentions that a specimen was sent for pathological examination, but does not provide any details about the findings or the implications for the patient's diagnosis and treatment. It is important to include relevant information from the pathological examination in the surgical report.\n\nOverall, the surgical report should be more comprehensive, providing detailed information about the surgical procedure, postoperative care, complications, and pathological findings. This will ensure accurate documentation and facilitate better communication among healthcare providers involved in the patient's care.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, and iodine is used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips. After 5 minutes of vasoconstriction with 1ml cotton soaked in adrenaline, the bilateral sphenoid sinus opening is explored using a neuroendoscope. The right middle turbinate is pushed laterally, and the sphenoid sinus opening is opened using a monopolar electrocautery until the nasal mucosa between the sphenoid sinus opening and the posterior nasal aperture is exposed. The bony nasal septum is exposed, and the sphenoid sinus floor is enlarged using a high-speed drill, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm X 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the sphenoid sinus floor is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The bony septum inside the sphenoid sinus is removed using a microdrill. The sellar floor bone window is further enlarged to 1.3cm X 1.0cm using a microdrill, and the dura mater of the sellar floor is carefully incised using a microhook knife. A soft, grayish-white tumor tissue is visible on the left side of the pituitary wing, with poor blood supply. The tumor is clearly identified, without a pseudocapsule. The medial wall of the bilateral cavernous sinuses is intact, as well as the sellar septum. The tumor is completely resected, with partial resection of the pituitary gland. Tissue samples are taken using forceps, and the tumor cavity is carefully scraped using various sizes of curettes. The tumor has invaded the right side of the sellar floor dura mater and bone. The tumor cavity is irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. A thorough examination reveals no cerebrospinal fluid leak. The sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater and hydroxyapatite. The nasal cavities are packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery went smoothly, with a total surgical time of 1.5 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A tumor specimen measuring approximately 8\u00d78\u00d75mm3 is resected during the surgery, and a portion of it is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of the operation and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Lack of detailed description of the anesthesia process: The surgical report does not provide specific information about the anesthesia administration, such as the type and dosage of anesthesia used, monitoring parameters, and any complications or challenges encountered during anesthesia. It is important to include this information for a comprehensive surgical report.\n\nSuggestion: Include a section in the surgical report dedicated to the anesthesia process, providing details about the type and dosage of anesthesia used, monitoring parameters, and any relevant information about the patient's response to anesthesia.\n\n2. Incomplete description of the surgical approach: The surgical report does not provide a clear description of the surgical approach used, including the specific incisions made, the use of neuronavigation or other guidance techniques, and the rationale behind the chosen approach. This information is important for understanding the surgical technique and decision-making process.\n\nSuggestion: Include a section in the surgical report dedicated to the surgical approach, providing a detailed description of the incisions made, the use of guidance techniques, and the rationale behind the chosen approach.\n\n3. Lack of information about intraoperative monitoring: The surgical report does not mention any intraoperative monitoring techniques used, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. These techniques are commonly used in neurosurgery to ensure the safety and accuracy of the procedure.\n\nSuggestion: Include a section in the surgical report dedicated to intraoperative monitoring, providing details about the techniques used, the findings observed, and any relevant information about the impact on the surgical decision-making process.\n\n4. Inadequate description of hemostasis and closure: The surgical report briefly mentions the use of bipolar electrocoagulation and other hemostatic measures, but does not provide a detailed description of the hemostasis techniques used or the closure of the surgical site. This information is important for assessing the adequacy of hemostasis and the integrity of the surgical closure.\n\nSuggestion: Include a section in the surgical report dedicated to hemostasis and closure, providing a detailed description of the techniques used, the findings observed, and any relevant information about the integrity of the surgical closure.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and organization. It is important to provide a comprehensive and structured report that includes all relevant information about the surgical procedure, anesthesia, monitoring, and postoperative care.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame after anesthesia.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis were incised, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially after intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep, indicating a high-grade glioma.\n- The tumor was resected using suction device, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- Hemostasis was confirmed to be satisfactory.\n- The ventricle and surgical field were flushed and a drainage tube was placed.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n- The bleeding during the operation was approximately 100ml, and no blood transfusion was performed.\n- The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the surgical approach and technique used for tumor resection. It would be beneficial to provide more specific details on the steps taken to ensure complete tumor removal and minimize damage to surrounding structures.\n\n2. Limited information on the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques. It would be helpful to mention if any electrophysiological monitoring or other modalities were used to guide the surgical procedure and ensure the preservation of important neurological functions.\n\n3. Insufficient information on the closure and reconstruction of the surgical site. It would be important to describe the specific techniques used to suture the dural resection edge, secure the artificial dura mater, and achieve a watertight closure.\n\n4. Lack of information on post-operative care and follow-up. It would be valuable to mention the post-operative management plan, including pain control, monitoring for complications, and the timeline for follow-up visits and imaging studies.\n\n5. Inadequate documentation of the patient's condition and vital signs during the surgery. It is essential to include detailed information on the patient's hemodynamic stability, oxygenation, and other relevant parameters throughout the procedure.\n\n6. Absence of information on the involvement of other surgical team members, such as anesthesiologists and nurses. It would be beneficial to acknowledge their contributions and highlight their roles in ensuring the safety and success of the surgery.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more comprehensive information on the surgical approach, techniques used, post-operative care, and involvement of the surgical team.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine solution, and the nasal mucosa was constricted using a cotton pad soaked in 1ml of adrenaline for 5 minutes.\n- The bilateral sphenoid sinus openings were explored using a neuroendoscope, and the right middle turbinate was pushed laterally.\n- The sphenoid sinus opening was then opened using a monopolar electrocautery, extending it to the posterior nasal aperture to expose the bony nasal septum.\n- The sphenoid sinus floor was enlarged using a high-speed drill, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The removed bone fragment was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n- The scar tissue within the sphenoid sinus was removed.\n- The sellar floor bone window was further enlarged using a microdrill to a size of 1.3cm x 1.0cm.\n- The dura mater of the sellar floor was carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue with rich blood supply and clear boundaries.\n- The tumor was completely resected, with partial resection of the surrounding pituitary tissue. Tissue samples were taken for pathological examination.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n- The surgical site was inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and none was found.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater and collagen surgical hemostatic material.\n- Nasal tampons were placed in both nasal cavities and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery lasted for 2 hours, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 400ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n\n- The surgical report lacks details regarding the positioning of the patient, the use of neuronavigation, and the specific steps taken during the tumor resection.\n- The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative MRI.\n- There is no mention of the closure of the dural resection edge or the placement of a drainage tube.\n- The report does not provide information on the closure of the galea aponeurosis or the suturing of the scalp.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n- Include more specific details about the patient positioning, the use of neuronavigation, and the steps taken during the tumor resection.\n- Mention the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative MRI, if applicable.\n- Provide information on the closure of the dural resection edge and the placement of a drainage tube.\n- Include details about the closure of the galea aponeurosis and the suturing of the scalp.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved to provide a more comprehensive overview of the surgical procedure.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical bed in a head-down position. This is consistent with the standard surgical position for this procedure. (Grade A)\n\n- The surgical field was sterilized and drapes were applied. The nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine. The use of iodine for disinfection is consistent with standard surgical practice. (Grade A)\n\n- Nasal speculum was used to visualize the surgical site. Cotton soaked with 1ml of adrenaline was applied to the nasal mucosa for vasoconstriction. This is a standard practice to minimize bleeding during the procedure. (Grade A)\n\n- The surgeon used a monopolar electrocautery to make an incision from the nasal cavity to the nasopharynx, exposing the bony nasal septum. This is consistent with the standard surgical approach. (Grade A)\n\n- A high-speed drill was used to create a bone window in the sphenoid sinus, and the bone fragment was preserved for later repair. This is a standard step in the procedure. (Grade A)\n\n- The surgeon used a microdrill to further enlarge the bone window at the sellar floor. This is consistent with the standard surgical technique. (Grade A)\n\n- The surgeon carefully incised the dura mater at the sellar floor and observed the presence of yellow-green fluid, indicating a possible pituitary apoplexy. This observation is important for diagnosis and treatment planning. (Grade A)\n\n- The tumor was visualized within the sellar region, with no evidence of a capsule and intact medial walls of the cavernous sinuses. The tumor was completely resected, and tumor specimens were collected for further analysis. This is consistent with the standard surgical goal. (Grade A)\n\n- The sellar cavity was irrigated with saline to ensure complete removal of tumor tissue. No cerebrospinal fluid leakage was observed. This is a standard practice to prevent post-operative complications. (Grade A)\n\n- The dura mater at the sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. This is a standard step in the procedure. (Grade A)\n\n- The nasal cavity was packed with expandable sponges and covered with sterile dressings. This is consistent with the standard post-operative care. (Grade A)\n\n- The surgery was completed within 1 hour with minimal blood loss. The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room. This is a standard outcome for this procedure. (Grade A)\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n- The surgical report lacks specific details about the imaging procedure and the specific views that were captured. It is important to include this information for a comprehensive surgical report. (Grade B)\n\n- The report does not mention the use of neuronavigation or any intraoperative imaging techniques. These technologies are commonly used in modern surgical practice and should be included in the report. (Grade B)\n\n- The report does not provide information about the patient's pre-operative condition, such as symptoms or diagnostic findings. This information is important for understanding the context of the surgery. (Grade B)\n\n- The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative MRI. These techniques are commonly used to ensure the safety and accuracy of the procedure. (Grade B)\n\n- The report does not provide information about the post-operative care plan, such as pain management or follow-up imaging. This information is important for the patient's recovery and should be included in the report. (Grade B)\n\nOverall Grade: B",

The bone fragment from the posterior wall was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n- The bony septum was removed using a microdrill, and the sellar floor bone window was further enlarged to 1.3cm X 1.0cm using a microdrill.\n- The dura mater of the sellar floor was carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue in the sellar and suprasellar region. The tumor was well-defined with no capsule, and the bilateral medial walls of the cavernous sinus were intact.\n- The tumor was completely resected, with partial resection of the pituitary gland. Tissue samples were taken for pathological examination.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n- The dura mater of the sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater.\n- The nasal cavities were packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery lasted for 1 hour, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. The surgical report lacks details about the anesthesia process, including the type of anesthesia used, the patient's response to anesthesia, and any complications or adverse events during anesthesia. It is important to include this information for a comprehensive surgical report.\n\n2. The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative imaging techniques, such as intraoperative ultrasound or neuronavigation, which are commonly used in brain tumor surgeries. Including information about these techniques and their findings can provide a more complete picture of the surgical procedure.\n\n3. The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative MRI. These techniques are important for ensuring the safety and accuracy of the surgery, especially when dealing with tumors near critical structures. It is recommended to include information about the use of these monitoring techniques and their findings.\n\n4. The report does not provide information about the closure of the surgical incision, including the type of sutures used and the technique employed. This information is important for assessing the quality of wound closure and preventing post-operative complications.\n\n5. The report does not mention the use of any post-operative measures, such as the placement of a drainage tube or the administration of post-operative medications. Including information about these measures can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the post-operative care provided to the patient.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by including more information about the anesthesia process, intraoperative imaging and monitoring techniques, wound closure, and post-operative care measures.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, placed on a head frame, and fixed.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this.\n- The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- At this time, the meningeal tension is slightly higher, and dural suspension is performed.\n- After intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, the dura mater was incised radially.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed that there was a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of \u200b\u200bthe temporoparietal area.\n- Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep.\n- The rapid freezing pathology may indicate that it is a high-grade glioma.\n- According to the rough boundary of the tumor, the suction device, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors are used to separate bluntly and sharply, and gradually go deep into the blood vessels.\n- Red, soft and uneven texture, rich blood supply, the size of the resected lesion is about 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of \u200b\u200bthe lateral ventricle is open.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring showed that the anterior tumor invaded the posterior limb of the internal capsule, so it was not resected.\n- After the tumor was basically removed under the microscope, intraoperative MRI was performed, which showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The peripheral wall of the residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation, and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze to further enhance the hemostatic effect.\n- The systolic blood pressure increased to the entrance blood pressure. It was confirmed that the hemostasis was satisfactory, the brain pulse was good, and there was no foreign body remains.\n- The ventricle and the surgical field are flushed and a drainage tube is placed.\n- The dural resection edge is sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater to keep the dura mater intact.\n- Titanium alloy nail plate is used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly; the scalp was sutured in sequence, covered with sterile dressing, and returned to the ward safely.\n- The bleeding during the operation was about 100ml, no blood transfusion was performed, and the specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of this operation and suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation: The surgical report lacks specific details about the patient's preoperative condition, the specific steps taken during the surgery, and the postoperative care plan. It is important to provide a comprehensive and detailed report to ensure accurate documentation and continuity of care. \n\n2. Inconsistent terminology: The report uses different terms to describe the same procedures, such as \"milling cutter\" and \"high-speed drill.\" It is important to use standardized terminology to ensure clear communication and understanding among healthcare professionals. \n\n3. Incomplete information: The report does not mention the use of any imaging techniques, such as CT scans or MRI, for preoperative planning or intraoperative guidance. It is important to include this information to provide a complete picture of the surgical process. \n\n4. Lack of discussion on complications: The report does not mention any potential complications that may have occurred during the surgery or any measures taken to address them. It is important to document any complications and their management to ensure proper follow-up care. \n\n5. Inadequate description of tumor resection: The report does not provide detailed information about the extent of tumor resection, such as the percentage of tumor removed or any residual tumor. This information is crucial for assessing the success of the surgery and planning further treatment. \n\n6. Limited information on hemostasis: The report briefly mentions the use of bipolar electrocoagulation and other hemostatic materials, but does not provide specific details on the techniques used or the effectiveness of hemostasis. It is important to document the steps taken to achieve hemostasis and any challenges encountered. \n\n7. Lack of postoperative care instructions: The report does not mention any specific postoperative care instructions given to the patient, such as wound care, pain management, or follow-up appointments. It is important to provide clear and detailed instructions to ensure proper recovery and minimize complications. \n\nOverall, the surgical report is inconsistent with the standard surgical process. It lacks important details, terminology consistency, and comprehensive documentation. To improve the report, it is recommended to provide a more detailed description of the surgical procedures, use standardized terminology, include imaging information, discuss complications and their management, provide specific details on tumor resection and hemostasis, and provide clear postoperative care instructions.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, and iodine is used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips. Cotton pads soaked in 1ml of adrenaline are applied to the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes to shrink the nasal turbinate. \n\nThe surgeon then proceeds with the surgery by performing a nasal endoscopy to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus opening. The right middle turbinate is removed using a monopolar electrocautery. The surgeon then uses a monopolar electrocautery to open the sphenoid sinus opening and expose the bony nasal septum. \n\nA high-speed drill is used to enlarge the sphenoid sinus cavity by removing the bony wall on the ventral side. A bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm is created, and a bone fragment from the ventral wall of the sphenoid sinus is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The surgeon then uses the drill under microscopic guidance to further enlarge the sellar floor bone window to 1.3cm x 1.0cm. \n\nA microhook knife is used to carefully incise the dura mater at the sellar floor, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue in the sellar and suprasellar region. The tumor is clearly identified, without a pseudocapsule, and the right medial wall of the cavernous sinus is found to be defective. The surgeon uses scissors to open the medial wall of the cavernous sinus and removes the tumor tissue from the cavernous sinus. The course of the carotid artery is visualized during the procedure. \n\nAfter complete tumor resection, the tumor cavity is irrigated with saline and no residual tumor tissue is observed. The surgical field is carefully inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and none is found. The sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater and hydroxyapatite. The nasal cavities are packed with nasal tampons and covered with sterile dressings. \n\nThe surgery proceeds smoothly, with a total surgical time of 2.5 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 200ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A portion of the resected tumor measuring approximately 30x24x25mm3 is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Inconsistent surgical positioning: The surgical report mentions placing the patient in the left lateral decubitus position, but the standard surgical procedure requires the patient to be placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. It is important to ensure accurate reporting of the patient's positioning during surgery.\n\n2. Inadequate description of surgical incision: The surgical report does not provide specific details about the incision made for the surgery. It is important to include information about the location, size, and type of incision used in the procedure.\n\n3. Lack of information on intraoperative monitoring: The surgical report does not mention any intraoperative monitoring techniques used during the procedure. It is important to include details about the use of neuronavigation, electrophysiological monitoring, and intraoperative imaging to guide the surgical resection and ensure patient safety.\n\n4. Incomplete description of tumor resection: The surgical report does not provide a clear description of the extent of tumor resection and any residual tumor tissue. It is important to include information about the completeness of the resection and any findings from intraoperative imaging or frozen section pathology.\n\n5. Insufficient details on hemostasis and closure: The surgical report does not provide specific information about the techniques used for hemostasis and closure of the surgical site. It is important to include details about the use of hemostatic agents, suturing techniques, and any drainage placement.\n\n6. Lack of information on post-operative care: The surgical report does not mention any post-operative care instructions or plans for follow-up. It is important to include information about wound care, pain management, and any necessary post-operative imaging or appointments.\n\nOverall, the surgical report has several inconsistencies and lacks important details regarding the surgical procedure. It is important to ensure accurate and comprehensive reporting of the surgical process to facilitate proper documentation and communication among healthcare providers.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, placed on a head frame, and fixed. \n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this. \n- The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding. \n- The skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling. \n- At this time, the meningeal tension is slightly higher, and dural suspension is performed. \n- After intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, the dura mater was incised radially. \n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed that there was a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of \u200b\u200bthe temporoparietal area. \n- Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep. \n- The rapid freezing pathology may indicate that it is a high-grade glioma. \n- According to the rough boundary of the tumor, the suction device, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors are used to separate bluntly and sharply, and gradually go deep into the blood vessels. \n- Red, soft and uneven texture, rich blood supply, the size of the resected lesion is about 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm. \n- The triangular area of \u200b\u200bthe lateral ventricle is open. \n- Electrophysiological monitoring showed that the anterior tumor invaded the posterior limb of the internal capsule, so it was not resected. \n- After the tumor was basically removed under the microscope, intraoperative MRI was performed, which showed subtotal resection of the lesion. \n- The peripheral wall of the residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation, and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze to further enhance the hemostatic effect. \n- The systolic blood pressure increased to the entrance blood pressure. \n- It was confirmed that the hemostasis was satisfactory, the brain pulse was good, and there was no foreign body remains. \n- The ventricle and the surgical field are flushed and a drainage tube is placed. \n- The dural resection edge is sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater to keep the dura mater intact. \n- Titanium alloy nail plate is used for free bone plate reduction. \n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly; the scalp was sutured in sequence, covered with sterile dressing, and returned to the ward safely. \n- The bleeding during the operation was about 100ml, no blood transfusion was performed, and the specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. The surgical report lacks specific details about the positioning of the patient, such as the degree of elevation of the head and the use of a head frame. It is important to provide precise information about the patient's position to ensure accuracy and reproducibility in future surgeries. \n\nSuggestion: Include specific details about the patient's positioning, such as the exact degree of head elevation and the type of head frame used.\n\n2. The report does not mention the use of any neuronavigation system during the surgery. Neuronavigation is an important tool for precise tumor localization and resection. \n\nSuggestion: Include information about the use of neuronavigation and its role in guiding the surgical procedure.\n\n3. The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative ultrasound. These techniques are crucial for ensuring the safety of critical structures and optimizing tumor resection.\n\nSuggestion: Include information about the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques and their findings during the surgery.\n\n4. The report does not provide specific details about the closure of the surgical site, such as the type of sutures used or the method of wound closure. \n\nSuggestion: Include information about the closure technique used, including the type of sutures and any additional measures taken to ensure proper wound healing.\n\n5. The report does not mention the use of any postoperative measures, such as postoperative care instructions or follow-up plans.\n\nSuggestion: Include information about postoperative care instructions, such as wound care, pain management, and follow-up plans for the patient.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks specific details in certain areas and could benefit from providing more comprehensive information about the surgical procedure, including positioning, localization techniques, monitoring, closure techniques, and postoperative care.",

Neuronavigation registration was performed to ensure accurate localization of the surgical target. The surgical field was prepared and draped, and the nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine solution. The nasal mucosa was then treated with a cotton pad soaked in 1ml of epinephrine to shrink the nasal turbinates.\n\nThe surgical procedure began with the use of a neuroendoscope to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings. The right middle turbinate was gently pushed aside using a monopolar electrocautery to create a nasal mucosal flap for repair. This exposed the bony nasal septum. The navigation system was used again to confirm the position of the sella turcica, and a bone window measuring 1.5cm X 1.5cm was created. \n\nA microhook knife was used to carefully incise the thickened dura mater and scar tissue at the sellar base.

Lack of detailed information on the tumor characteristics: The surgical report does not provide specific details about the tumor, such as its location, size, and histopathological diagnosis. It is important to include this information for a comprehensive surgical report.\n\nSuggestion: The surgeon should provide a detailed description of the tumor, including its location within the brain, size, and histopathological diagnosis based on frozen section analysis or postoperative pathology.\n\n2. Incomplete information on intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention the specific findings of intraoperative monitoring, such as motor or sensory evoked potentials, to assess the functional integrity of the surrounding brain structures.\n\nSuggestion: The surgeon should include information on the intraoperative monitoring findings, including any changes in motor or sensory evoked potentials, to evaluate the functional status of the surrounding brain tissue.\n\n3. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report does not mention the postoperative care plan, including the use of antibiotics, analgesics, or any specific instructions for the patient's recovery.\n\nSuggestion: The surgeon should provide details on the postoperative care plan, including the administration of antibiotics and analgesics, wound care instructions, and any potential complications the patient should watch out for.\n\n4. Inadequate description of hemostasis techniques: The report does not provide sufficient information on the specific hemostasis techniques used during the surgery, such as the use of hemostatic agents or suturing techniques.\n\nSuggestion: The surgeon should describe the hemostasis techniques in more detail, including the use of hemostatic agents, suturing techniques, and any measures taken to ensure adequate hemostasis.\n\n5. Lack of information on the closure of the surgical site: The report does not mention the specific steps taken to close the surgical site, such as the type of sutures used or the closure technique employed.\n\nSuggestion: The surgeon should provide information on the closure of the surgical site, including the type of sutures used, the closure technique employed, and any measures taken to ensure a secure closure.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more comprehensive information on the tumor characteristics, intraoperative monitoring findings, postoperative care plan, hemostasis techniques, and closure of the surgical site.",

Lack of detailed information on the tumor characteristics: The surgical report does not provide specific information about the tumor, such as its location, size, and histopathological diagnosis. It is important to include these details for a comprehensive surgical report.\n\nSuggestion: Provide a detailed description of the tumor, including its location, size, and histopathological diagnosis, if available.\n\n2. Incomplete information on the extent of resection: The report mentions that the tumor was \"basically removed,\" but does not provide a clear assessment of the extent of resection. It is important to accurately document the degree of tumor removal to evaluate the success of the surgery.\n\nSuggestion: Provide a detailed assessment of the extent of tumor resection, such as gross total resection, subtotal resection, or partial resection.\n\n3. Lack of information on postoperative complications: The report does not mention any postoperative complications or adverse events. It is important to document any complications that may have occurred during or after the surgery.\n\nSuggestion: Include information on postoperative complications, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage, infection, or neurological deficits, if applicable.\n\n4. Inadequate description of hemostasis techniques: The report briefly mentions the use of bipolar electrocoagulation and other hemostatic materials, but does not provide specific details on the techniques used or the effectiveness of hemostasis.\n\nSuggestion: Provide a detailed description of the hemostasis techniques used, including the specific instruments and materials employed, and evaluate the effectiveness of hemostasis.\n\n5. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report does not mention the postoperative care plan, including the use of antibiotics, pain management, or follow-up instructions.\n\nSuggestion: Include information on the postoperative care plan, including the administration of antibiotics, pain management strategies, and follow-up instructions for the patient.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more comprehensive information on the tumor characteristics, extent of resection, postoperative complications, hemostasis techniques, and postoperative care plan.",

Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this. The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding; the skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling. At this time, the meningeal tension is slightly higher, and dural suspension is performed. After intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, the dura mater was incised radially. Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed that there was a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of \u200b\u200bthe temporoparietal area. Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep. The rapid freezing pathology may indicate that it is a high-grade glioma.

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly tilted and fixed using a head frame.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped, and a coronal incision was made to access the tumor.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were sequentially incised, and scalp clips were used for hemostasis.\n- The bone flap was created using a drill at specific locations, and bone wax was applied to the edges of the bone flap.\n- The dura mater was opened, and the tumor was visualized using neuronavigation and intraoperative ultrasound.\n- The tumor was carefully dissected and removed using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- Intraoperative MRI was performed to assess the extent of tumor resection.\n- The residual cavity was hemostatically controlled using bipolar electrocoagulation, gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently, and an artificial dura mater was used to cover the dura mater.\n- The bone flap was fixed using a titanium alloy nail plate.\n- The scalp and galeal aponeurosis were sutured, and the incision site was covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely transferred back to the ward.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation: The surgical report should include specific measurements of the tumor size, location, and involvement of adjacent structures. This information is important for accurate post-operative assessment and follow-up. \n\n2. Inadequate description of tumor characteristics: The report should provide more details about the tumor's appearance, consistency, and vascularity. This information can help in determining the tumor grade and planning further treatment.\n\n3. Lack of information on intraoperative monitoring: The report should mention the use of electrophysiological monitoring techniques, such as motor and sensory evoked potentials, to ensure the preservation of neurological function during tumor resection.\n\n4. Insufficient information on post-operative care: The report should include details about the post-operative management, such as the use of antibiotics, pain control measures, and specific instructions for wound care.\n\n5. Incomplete documentation of blood loss and transfusion: The report should provide accurate measurements of blood loss during the surgery and mention if any blood transfusion was performed. This information is crucial for assessing the patient's hemodynamic stability and post-operative recovery.\n\n6. Lack of information on specimen handling: The report should mention the proper handling and labeling of the tumor specimen for pathological examination. This ensures accurate diagnosis and further treatment planning.\n\n7. Absence of information on complications or unexpected events: The report should mention any intraoperative complications, such as vascular injury or cerebrospinal fluid leak, and how they were managed. This information is important for learning from the surgical experience and improving patient outcomes in the future.\n\nOverall, the surgical report should provide a comprehensive and detailed account of the surgical procedure, including pre-operative planning, intraoperative techniques, and post-operative care. It should accurately document the surgical steps, findings, and outcomes to facilitate communication among the surgical team and ensure optimal patient care.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and fixed with a Mayfield head frame. The surgical bed was adjusted to a head-up, feet-down position.\n- After successful Brainlab navigation registration, the surgical field was prepared and draped. The nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine solution, and nasal speculum was used to shrink the nasal mucosa with a cotton pad soaked in 1ml of adrenaline.\n- The surgeon performed a neuroendoscopic exploration and observed a partial defect in the nasal septum from the previous surgery. The right middle turbinate was pushed laterally, and the nasal mucosa was separated from the nasal septum using a monopolar electrocautery. Scarring was observed in the direction of the sphenoid sinus.\n- After reconfirming the navigation position, the surgeon gradually removed the scar tissue in the sphenoid sinus using Kerrison rongeurs. The navigation probe was repositioned, and a microdrill was used to enlarge the sellar floor bone window to 1.5cm x 1.0cm. The surgeon carefully opened the sellar dura mater using a microhook knife, and yellowish fluid with cholesterol-like crystals was observed, indicating the presence of a cystic lesion located above the pituitary gland.\n- The cystic wall was carefully dissected and removed, with noticeable adhesions to the arachnoid membrane above. The surgeon ensured complete removal of the cystic wall. The bilateral medial walls of the cavernous sinuses were intact, and no resection of the pituitary gland was performed.\n- The cystic cavity was irrigated with normal saline, and no residual tissue was observed. The arachnoid membrane above the sella turcica showed needle-like defects with cerebrospinal fluid leakage.\n- A lateral incision was made on the patient's left thigh, and autologous fat and fascia were harvested for repair. The arachnoid membrane was covered with an artificial dura mater, and the fat was placed in the sella turcica. The surface was covered with autologous fascia, and iodine-impregnated gauze was applied to prevent displacement of the fat and fascia. The nasal cavities were packed with nasal tampons and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery proceeded smoothly, with a total operation time of 2 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A cystic lesion measuring approximately 15x12x14mm3 was resected, and a portion was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the patient's preoperative condition, such as symptoms, imaging findings, and preoperative evaluation. It is important to include this information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the case and guide the surgical approach.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical approach and technique used. The report should provide more specific details on the surgical incision, bone removal, and dural closure techniques employed during the procedure.\n\n3. Limited information on intraoperative monitoring and navigation. It is essential to mention the use of intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, as well as any other monitoring modalities utilized during the surgery.\n\n4. Insufficient discussion on the extent of tumor resection and the presence of residual tumor. The report should clearly state the extent of tumor removal and any residual tumor identified on intraoperative imaging.\n\n5. Lack of information on postoperative care and follow-up plan. It is important to mention the postoperative care measures, including pain management, wound care, and plans for postoperative imaging and follow-up visits.\n\n6. Incomplete documentation of potential complications encountered during the surgery and their management. The report should include any intraoperative complications, such as bleeding or cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and describe the steps taken to address them.\n\n7. Absence of a final pathological diagnosis. The report should include the results of the pathological examination of the resected tissue, as this information is crucial for determining the nature of the lesion and guiding further treatment decisions.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some essential details and should be revised to provide a more comprehensive and standardized documentation of the surgical procedure.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and drapes were applied, with iodine used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips.\n- The nasal mucosa was shrunk using cotton soaked in a solution containing 1ml of adrenaline.\n- The sellar floor was accessed through the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings, with the right middle turbinate pushed laterally and the sphenoid sinus opening enlarged using a monopolar electrocautery.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed by removing the bone and enlarging the bony window to 1.5cm x 1.5cm.\n- The tumor was visualized in the left wing of the pituitary gland, with clear boundaries and no pseudocapsule.\n- The tumor was completely resected, with partial resection of the surrounding pituitary tissue.\n- Tumor specimens were collected using forceps and various sizes of curettes.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n- Cerebrospinal fluid leakage was not detected.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater.\n- The nasal cavity was packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery lasted 1.5 hours, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the anesthesia process: It would be beneficial to include information on the type of anesthesia used, any complications or challenges encountered during anesthesia, and the patient's vital signs throughout the procedure.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the tumor characteristics: The report should provide more details about the size, location, and histological type of the tumor. This information is crucial for accurate pathological examination and further treatment planning.\n\n3. Insufficient documentation of intraoperative monitoring: It is important to mention if any intraoperative monitoring techniques were used, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. This information helps assess the safety and effectiveness of the surgery.\n\n4. Lack of information on post-operative care: The report should include details about the post-operative care provided to the patient, such as pain management, antibiotic prophylaxis, and follow-up plans. This information is essential for ensuring a successful recovery and preventing complications.\n\n5. Incomplete documentation of the surgical technique: The report should provide a more comprehensive description of the surgical steps, including the use of specific instruments, the sequence of tissue dissection, and the closure technique. This level of detail helps ensure consistency and accuracy in surgical documentation.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more comprehensive information about the anesthesia process, tumor characteristics, intraoperative monitoring, post-operative care, and surgical technique.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, placed on a head frame, and fixed.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this.\n- The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- At this time, the meningeal tension is slightly higher, and dural suspension is performed.\n- After intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, the dura mater was incised radially.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed that there was a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of \u200b\u200bthe temporoparietal area.\n- Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep.\n- The rapid freezing pathology may indicate that it is a high-grade glioma.\n- According to the rough boundary of the tumor, the suction device, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors are used to separate bluntly and sharply, and gradually go deep into the blood vessels.\n- Red, soft and uneven texture, rich blood supply, the size of the resected lesion is about 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of \u200b\u200bthe lateral ventricle is open.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring showed that the anterior tumor invaded the posterior limb of the internal capsule, so it was not resected.\n- After the tumor was basically removed under the microscope, intraoperative MRI was performed, which showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The peripheral wall of the residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation, and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze to further enhance the hemostatic effect.\n- The systolic blood pressure increased to the entrance blood pressure. It was confirmed that the hemostasis was satisfactory, the brain pulse was good, and there was no foreign body remains.\n- The ventricle and the surgical field are flushed and a drainage tube is placed.\n- The dural resection edge is sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater to keep the dura mater intact.\n- Titanium alloy nail plate is used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly; the scalp was sutured in sequence, covered with sterile dressing, and returned to the ward safely.\n- The bleeding during the operation was about 100ml, no blood transfusion was performed, and the specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. The surgical report lacks specific details about the anesthesia process, such as the type of anesthesia used and any complications or challenges encountered. It is important to provide a comprehensive overview of the anesthesia process for a thorough surgical report.\n\n2. The report does not mention the use of any prophylactic antibiotics during the surgery. It is essential to include information about antibiotic administration to prevent postoperative infections.\n\n3. The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as EEG or somatosensory evoked potentials, to ensure the safety of the patient's neurological function during the surgery. Including details about intraoperative monitoring would enhance the completeness of the report.\n\n4. The report does not provide information about the closure of the surgical site, such as the type of sutures used or any specific techniques employed. It is important to include details about the closure process to ensure proper wound healing and minimize the risk of complications.\n\n5. The report does not mention the use of any postoperative pain management strategies. It is crucial to include information about pain management to ensure the patient's comfort and facilitate their recovery.\n\n6. The report does not provide information about the postoperative follow-up plan, including any scheduled imaging studies or clinic visits. Including details about the postoperative care plan would enhance the overall quality of the report.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could benefit from a more comprehensive and standardized approach. It is important to ensure that all relevant aspects of the surgery are documented accurately to provide a complete and informative report.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n1. Anesthesia: The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and anesthesia was administered.\n\n2. Neuronavigation: Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n\n3. Incision: A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was made based on the tumor projection. The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised and scalp clips were used to control bleeding.\n\n4. Bone Removal: The bone plate was cut using a milling cutter after drilling. Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n\n5. Tumor Resection: Intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation were used to guide the resection. The tumor tissue was identified and resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors. The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm x 6cm x 6cm.\n\n6. Electrophysiological Monitoring: Electrophysiological monitoring was used to confirm the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region. The tumor was not resected if it invaded the posterior limb of the internal capsule.\n\n7. Intraoperative MRI: Intraoperative MRI was performed to assess the extent of tumor resection. It showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n\n8. Hemostasis: The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze to enhance hemostasis.\n\n9. Closure: The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater. A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction. The galea aponeurosis and scalp were sutured and covered with sterile dressing.\n\n10. Postoperative Care: The patient was safely returned to the ward. The bleeding during the operation was approximately 100ml and no blood transfusion was required. The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information: The surgical report does not provide specific details about the tumor location, grade, or any complications encountered during the procedure. It is important to include these details for a comprehensive surgical report.\n\n2. Incomplete documentation: The report does not mention the use of any specific surgical instruments or techniques during the procedure. It is important to document all instruments and techniques used for future reference and to ensure consistency in surgical practices.\n\n3. Lack of postoperative follow-up: The report does not mention any postoperative care or follow-up plans for the patient. It is important to include information about postoperative care, such as wound care, pain management, and any necessary imaging or laboratory tests.\n\n4. Inadequate description of tumor resection: The report does not provide a clear description of the tumor resection process, including the boundaries of the tumor, the extent of resection, and any challenges encountered during the procedure. This information is crucial for evaluating the success of the surgery and planning further treatment if needed.\n\n5. Absence of complications: The report does not mention any complications or adverse events that occurred during the surgery. It is important to document any complications, such as bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding structures, to ensure appropriate management and follow-up.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks specific details and comprehensive documentation. It is important to provide a more detailed and thorough report to accurately reflect the surgical procedure and facilitate future patient care and research.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process:\n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was made based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised sequentially.\n- Scalp clips were used to control bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galeal aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially under intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation guidance.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm x 6cm x 6cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was opened.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the tumor characteristics and location: It would be beneficial to provide more specific details about the tumor, such as its histological type, grade, and precise location within the brain.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical technique: The report should include more information about the specific steps taken during the tumor resection, such as the use of intraoperative imaging, the extent of tumor removal, and any challenges encountered during the procedure.\n\n3. Limited information on postoperative care: The report should provide more details about the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications.\n\n4. Lack of information on the patient's condition and outcome: It would be helpful to include information about the patient's preoperative condition, any intraoperative complications, and the immediate postoperative outcome.\n\n5. Incomplete documentation of blood loss and transfusion: The report should provide accurate information on the amount of blood loss during the surgery and whether any blood transfusion was required.\n\n6. Insufficient information on the specimen sent for pathological examination: The report should specify the specific tissues or cells that were collected for pathological examination and provide details on the results, if available.\n\n7. Lack of information on the use of drainage: It would be beneficial to mention whether a drainage tube was placed and for how long it was kept in place.\n\n8. Inadequate documentation of the surgical time: The report should include the exact duration of the surgery, including the time from incision to closure.\n\n9. Absence of information on the patient's vital signs and anesthesia management: It would be helpful to include details about the patient's vital signs throughout the surgery and any specific anesthesia techniques or medications used.\n\n10. Lack of information on the surgical team: The report should mention the names and roles of all surgical team members involved in the procedure.\n\nOverall, the surgical report provided lacks some essential details and could be improved by including more specific information about the tumor resection, postoperative care, patient outcome, and other relevant aspects of the surgery.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, and the nasal cavity and lips are disinfected with iodine solution. After 1ml cotton soaked with adrenaline is applied to the nasal cavity for 5 minutes to shrink the nasal mucosa, the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings are explored using a nasal endoscope. The right middle turbinate is pushed outward, and the sphenoid sinus opening is then opened using a monopolar electrocautery until the nasal mucosa between the sphenoid sinus opening and the posterior nasal aperture is exposed. The bony nasal septum is exposed, and the sphenoid sinus floor is enlarged using a high-speed drill to create a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the sphenoid sinus floor is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The bony septum within the sphenoid sinus is removed using the drill. The sellar floor bone window is further enlarged using a microdrill to a size of 1.3cm x 1.0cm. The dura mater of the sellar floor is carefully incised using a microhook knife, and a gelatinous, liquefied, gray-white tissue is visible within the sella and above the sella. The tissue appears hypovascular and does not have a pseudocapsule. The medial walls of the bilateral cavernous sinuses are intact, and the sellar septum is intact. Tumor specimens are taken using forceps, and the tumor within the sella is carefully scraped using various sizes of curettes. The tumor cavity is irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. A thorough examination reveals no cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. The nasal cavities are packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery proceeds smoothly, with a total surgical time of 1.5 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the recovery room after the surgery. A tumor measuring approximately 15x15x17mm3 is resected, and a portion of it is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n1. The surgical report does not mention the specific positioning of the patient, such as the supine position with the head slightly extended. This information is important for understanding the surgical approach and access to the sellar region.\n2. The report does not provide details about the use of neuronavigation or any other guidance system during the surgery. This information is crucial for ensuring accurate tumor localization and precise surgical resection.\n3. The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. These techniques are important for assessing the functional integrity of surrounding structures and confirming the extent of tumor resection.\n4. The report does not provide information about the closure of the surgical site, such as the suturing technique used or the use of any hemostatic agents. This information is important for ensuring proper wound healing and preventing postoperative complications.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n1. Include specific details about the patient positioning, such as the supine position with the head slightly extended, to provide a comprehensive understanding of the surgical approach.\n2. Describe the use of neuronavigation or any other guidance system during the surgery to highlight the precision and accuracy of tumor localization and resection.\n3. Mention the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging, to emphasize the preservation of functional structures and the extent of tumor resection.\n4. Provide information about the closure of the surgical site, including the suturing technique used and the use of any hemostatic agents, to ensure proper wound healing and minimize postoperative complications.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- After the anesthesia was completed, the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped as usual.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised in sequence, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- Intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation were used to guide the incision of the dura mater.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal area.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep, and rapid freezing pathology indicated a high-grade glioma.\n- The tumor was resected using suction, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors, gradually going deep into the blood vessels.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open, but the anterior tumor invading the posterior limb of the internal capsule was not resected.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze for further hemostasis.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n- The bleeding during the operation was approximately 100ml, and no blood transfusion was performed.\n- The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the anesthesia process: The surgical report should include specific details about the type of anesthesia used, any complications or challenges encountered, and the patient's response to anesthesia. This information is important for evaluating the overall success of the surgery and ensuring patient safety. \n\nSuggestion: Include a section in the surgical report dedicated to the anesthesia process, providing a comprehensive overview of the anesthesia administration, monitoring, and patient response.\n\n2. Incomplete description of the tumor characteristics: The report mentions that the tumor was dark red, soft, and had a rich blood supply, but does not provide further details on its location, size, or specific features. \n\nSuggestion: Include a detailed description of the tumor, including its location within the brain, size, shape, and any notable characteristics observed during the surgery. This information is crucial for accurate pathological examination and future treatment planning.\n\n3. Lack of information on postoperative complications or challenges: The report does not mention any postoperative complications or challenges that may have occurred during the surgery or in the immediate postoperative period.\n\nSuggestion: Include a section in the surgical report dedicated to postoperative complications, detailing any issues encountered, such as bleeding, infection, or neurological deficits. This information is important for monitoring the patient's recovery and providing appropriate postoperative care.\n\n4. Insufficient information on the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques: The report briefly mentions the use of neuronavigation and electrophysiological monitoring but does not provide specific details on how these techniques were utilized or their findings.\n\nSuggestion: Include a detailed description of the intraoperative monitoring techniques used, including the specific equipment and methods employed, as well as any notable findings or adjustments made based on the monitoring results. This information is important for evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of these techniques in guiding the surgical procedure.\n\n5. Lack of information on the patient's postoperative condition and immediate recovery: The report does not mention the patient's vital signs, level of consciousness, or any immediate postoperative interventions or observations.\n\nSuggestion: Include a section in the surgical report dedicated to the patient's postoperative condition, including vital signs, level of consciousness, pain management, and any specific instructions or interventions provided for immediate recovery. This information is important for assessing the patient's initial response to the surgery and ensuring appropriate postoperative care.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, with the head slightly tilted back and the surgical bed in a head-up, feet-down position. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, and iodine is used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips. Cotton pads soaked in 1ml of adrenaline are used to shrink the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes. The surgeon then performs a neuroendoscopic exploration of the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings. The right middle turbinate is pushed outward, and the sphenoid sinus opening is opened using a monopolar electrocautery. The opening is extended to the posterior nasal aperture, exposing the bony nasal septum. A high-speed drill is used to remove the bony wall of the sphenoid sinus, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The removed bone fragment is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The bony septum inside the sphenoid sinus is also removed using the drill. The bone window of the sellar floor is further enlarged to 1.3cm x 1.0cm using a microdrill. Careful dissection with a microhook knife allows access to the tumor tissue, which appears soft, grayish-white in color, and poorly vascularized. The tumor is clearly defined, without a pseudocapsule. The medial walls of the bilateral cavernous sinuses are intact, as is the sellar septum. The tumor is completely resected, with partial resection of the pituitary gland. Tissue samples are taken for pathological examination, and the tumor cavity is carefully scraped using various sizes of curettes. The cavity is rinsed with saline, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. The surgical site is inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and the sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. The nasal cavities are packed with nasal tampons and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery proceeds smoothly, with a total operating time of 2.5 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A tumor specimen measuring approximately 10x10x8mm3 is sent for further examination and pathological analysis.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n- The surgical report lacks details regarding the specific steps taken during the surgery, such as the use of neuronavigation, the specific instruments used, and the techniques employed for tumor resection. It is important to provide a more comprehensive and detailed account of the surgical procedure.\n- The report does not mention the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring, to ensure the safety of critical structures during tumor resection. It is recommended to include information about the monitoring techniques used and their findings.\n- The report does not mention the closure of the surgical site, including the suturing of the galea aponeurosis and scalp. It is important to provide information about the closure technique and any additional measures taken to ensure proper wound healing.\n- The report does not mention the postoperative care plan, including the administration of antibiotics and pain management. It is crucial to include information about the postoperative care provided to the patient.\n- The report does not mention the presence or absence of any complications during or after the surgery. It is important to document any complications encountered and the steps taken to address them.\n\nOverall, the surgical report is inconsistent with the standard surgical process. It lacks important details and does not provide a comprehensive account of the surgery. It is recommended to revise the report to include the missing information and adhere to the standard surgical reporting guidelines.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head elevated approximately 20\u00b0 and the head tilted back. The surgical field is sterilized and drapes are placed. The nasal cavities are disinfected with iodine cotton swabs. Nasal cotton soaked in saline solution is used to shrink the blood vessels in the nasal mucosa. \n\nA mucosal incision is made on the right side of the nasal septum, and the right side of the nasal septum is carefully separated from the sphenoid sinus wall. The nasal septum and left side of the mucosa are then separated towards the left side, exposing the sphenoid sinus wall and the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings. The sphenoid sinus wall is drilled open, and the tumor tissue inside the sphenoid sinus is completely removed. The sellar floor is exposed, and the thickness of the bone is approximately 2mm. A window measuring approximately 10x10mm is created in the sellar floor. No blood or cerebrospinal fluid is observed during the puncture of the sellar floor dura mater. The dura mater is incised using a hook knife, and a light yellow fluid is observed to flow out. Soft, gray-white tumor tissue is visible inside the sella and above the sella. The tumor is well-defined with no capsule, and the bilateral cavernous sinuses and the sellar septum are intact. The tumor is completely resected, and a portion of the pituitary gland is also removed. Tissue samples are taken for pathological examination. The tumor cavity is irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. No cerebrospinal fluid leakage is detected. The sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. The nasal septum is restored to its normal anatomical position, and nasal cotton is placed in both nasal cavities and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery is completed successfully with a total surgical time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit.\n\nShortcomings of this operation compared to the standard surgical procedure:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation of the surgical approach and technique used.\n2. Inadequate description of the tumor characteristics, such as size, location, and histological type.\n3. Insufficient information on the use of intraoperative imaging techniques, such as neuronavigation or intraoperative MRI.\n4. No mention of the use of electrophysiological monitoring to assess functional areas and avoid damage to critical structures.\n5. Limited information on the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery.\n6. Lack of information on the closure technique used for the dura mater and the scalp.\n7. Incomplete documentation of the post-operative care instructions and pain management plan.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Provide a detailed description of the surgical approach, including the specific incision, bone removal technique, and exposure of the tumor.\n2. Include comprehensive information on the tumor characteristics, such as size, location, and histological type, to aid in the understanding of the surgical procedure.\n3. Describe the use of intraoperative imaging techniques, such as neuronavigation or intraoperative MRI, to guide the surgical resection and ensure maximal tumor removal.\n4. Emphasize the use of electrophysiological monitoring to preserve functional areas and avoid damage to critical structures.\n5.

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially after intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep, and resection was performed using a suction device, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected tumor measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- Hemostasis was confirmed, and there were no foreign body remains.\n- The ventricle and surgical field were flushed, and a drainage tube was placed.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n- The bleeding during the operation was about 100ml, and no blood transfusion was performed.\n- The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of this operation compared to the standard surgical procedure:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the anesthesia process and positioning of the patient.\n2. No mention of the use of neuronavigation during the surgery.\n3. Inadequate description of the tumor characteristics and grade.\n4. Insufficient information on the extent of tumor resection and confirmation of complete resection.\n5. Lack of details on the closure of the residual cavity and prevention of cerebrospinal fluid leakage.\n6. No mention of the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques such as electrophysiological monitoring.\n7. Incomplete description of the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery.\n8. Limited information on the closure of the dural resection edge and reconstruction of the dura mater.\n9. No mention of postoperative care and follow-up plan.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Provide a detailed description of the anesthesia process and patient positioning.\n2. Include information on the use of neuronavigation during the surgery.\n3. Provide a comprehensive description of the tumor characteristics, grade, and extent of resection.\n4. Include details on the closure of the residual cavity and prevention of cerebrospinal fluid leakage.\n5. Describe the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques such as electrophysiological monitoring.\n6. Provide a thorough description of the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery.\n7. Include details on the closure of the dural resection edge and reconstruction of the dura mater.\n8. Describe the postoperative care and follow-up plan for the patient.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame after anesthesia was completed.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped as usual.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling, and dural suspension was performed due to slightly higher meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially after intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors, gradually going deep into the blood vessels.\n- The resected lesion was approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm in size, with the triangular area of the lateral ventricle open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly, and the scalp was sutured in sequence.\n- The surgical field was flushed, and a drainage tube was placed.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater to keep it intact.\n- The bleeding during the operation was approximately 100ml, and no blood transfusion was performed.\n- The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation: The surgical report lacks specific details about the tumor location, histopathological findings, and any complications encountered during the procedure. It is important to provide a comprehensive and detailed account of the surgery for future reference and research purposes. \n\nSuggestion: Include specific information about the tumor location, histopathological findings, and any complications encountered during the procedure.\n\n2. Incomplete description of hemostasis techniques: The report does not provide sufficient information about the hemostasis techniques used during the surgery. It is important to document the specific methods employed to achieve hemostasis and ensure the absence of any residual bleeding.\n\nSuggestion: Describe in detail the hemostasis techniques used, such as the use of bipolar electrocoagulation, sutures, or other methods, and confirm the absence of any residual bleeding.\n\n3. Lack of information on post-operative care: The report does not mention the post-operative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up appointments. It is crucial to provide clear instructions for the patient's recovery and ensure appropriate post-operative care.\n\nSuggestion: Include information on the post-operative care plan, including pain management, wound care instructions, and follow-up appointments.\n\n4. Inadequate documentation of patient positioning and monitoring: The report does not mention the specific patient positioning during the surgery or the monitoring devices used to ensure patient safety and stability.\n\nSuggestion: Document the specific patient positioning during the surgery and mention the monitoring devices used to monitor vital signs and ensure patient stability.\n\n5. Lack of information on the surgical team: The report does not mention the names or roles of the surgical team members involved in the procedure.\n\nSuggestion: Include the names and roles of the surgical team members involved in the procedure to provide a complete overview of the surgical team's collaboration.\n\nOverall, the surgical report needs to provide more detailed information about the procedure, including tumor location, histopathological findings, hemostasis techniques, post-operative care plan, patient positioning, monitoring devices used, and the names and roles of the surgical team members.",

Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this. The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding; the skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling. At this time, the meningeal tension is slightly higher, and dural suspension is performed. After intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, the dura mater was incised radially. Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed that there was a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of \u200b\u200bthe temporoparietal area. Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep. The rapid freezing pathology may indicate that it is a high-grade glioma.

The surgical field was prepared and draped, and the nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine solution. Cotton soaked with 1ml of adrenaline was used to shrink the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes. The nasal mucosa was incised using a monopolar electrocautery, exposing the bony nasal septum. A defect in the anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus was observed, which was repaired using a bone graft from the sphenoid sinus floor. The bony septum within the sphenoid sinus was removed using a high-speed drill. The sellar floor was further expanded using a microdrill, and the dura mater was carefully incised using a microhook knife. Tumor tissue was visible on both sides of the pituitary gland, with a soft, grayish-white appearance and poor vascularity. The tumor was clearly identified and had no pseudocapsule. A defect in the medial wall of the right cavernous sinus was observed. The tumor was partially resected, and the surrounding tumor tissue was carefully scraped off. The sellar septum was intact, and the tumor was completely resected with partial resection of the pituitary gland. The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue was observed. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage was not detected. The sellar floor was reconstructed using artificial dura mater. Nasal cotton was used to pack both sides of the nasal cavity, and sterile dressings were applied. The surgery was successful, with a total surgical time of 2 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the anesthesia recovery room. A portion of the resected tumor, measuring approximately 10x5x5mm3, was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Inconsistent positioning: The surgical report mentions that the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, but the standard surgical procedure states that the patient should be placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. It is important to ensure consistency in reporting the patient's positioning during surgery.\n\n2. Incomplete description of surgical approach: The surgical report does not provide a detailed description of the surgical approach used, such as the specific incision made or the use of neuronavigation. It is important to include these details to provide a comprehensive overview of the surgical procedure.\n\n3. Lack of information on intraoperative monitoring: The surgical report does not mention any intraoperative monitoring techniques used, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative ultrasound. These monitoring techniques are important for ensuring patient safety and should be included in the surgical report.\n\n4. Inadequate description of tumor characteristics: The surgical report does not provide a detailed description of the tumor characteristics, such as its size, location, or histological type. These details are important for understanding the extent of the tumor resection and for further analysis.\n\n5. Insufficient information on hemostasis and closure: The surgical report does not provide a detailed description of the hemostasis techniques used or the closure of the surgical site. It is important to include information on these aspects to ensure proper wound healing and to prevent post-operative complications.\n\n6. Lack of information on post-operative care: The surgical report does not mention any specific post-operative care instructions or follow-up plans. It is important to include information on post-operative care, such as wound care, pain management, and follow-up appointments, to ensure proper healing and recovery.\n\nOverall, the surgical report has several inconsistencies and lacks important details. It is recommended to revise the report to provide a more comprehensive and accurate description of the surgical procedure.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical bed in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and drapes were applied, including iodine disinfection of the nasal cavity and lips.\n- The nasal mucosa was decongested using a cotton pad soaked in a solution containing 1ml of adrenaline.\n- The surgical team performed a neuroendoscopic exploration of the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings, followed by the use of a monopolar electrocautery to open the sphenoid sinus opening and expose the bony nasal septum.\n- A high-speed drill was used to enlarge the bone window on the ventral wall of the sphenoid sinus, with a final size of 1.5cm X 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the ventral wall was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n- The bone septum was removed using a microdrill, and the sellar floor bone window was further enlarged to 1.3cm X 1.0cm using a microdrill.\n- The dura mater of the sellar floor was carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing the tumor tissue in the sellar and suprasellar region. The tumor appeared grayish-white in color, with a fibrous texture and poor vascularity.\n- Tumor samples were obtained using forceps, and various sizes of curettes were used to carefully remove the tumor tissue from the sellar region.\n- The tumor was completely resected, with preservation of the medial wall of the cavernous sinus. Partial resection of the pituitary gland was performed, and a small defect was observed in the left upper corner of the sellar septum.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution to ensure no residual tumor tissue.\n- A 1cm X 2cm artificial dura mater was used to cover the sellar floor defect, and the sellar cavity was carefully inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage.\n- Biological glue was sprayed on the sellar floor position, and the nasal mucosa flap was repositioned.\n- The nasal cavity was packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery was successful, with a total surgical time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n- A tumor specimen measuring approximately 15mm X 10mm X 10mm was resected and sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the patient's preoperative evaluation, including blood tests, imaging studies, and endocrine function assessment. It is important to include these details in the surgical report to provide a comprehensive overview of the patient's condition before the surgery.\n\n2. Inconsistent information regarding the patient's position during the surgery. The surgical report mentions the patient being placed in the left lateral decubitus position, but the standard surgical procedure states that the patient should be in the supine position with the head slightly extended. This inconsistency should be addressed and clarified.\n\n3. Inadequate description of the tumor characteristics and location. The surgical report should provide more specific details about the tumor, such as its size, location, and relationship to surrounding structures. This information is crucial for understanding the extent of the tumor resection and assessing the surgical outcome.\n\n4. Lack of information on intraoperative monitoring and navigation techniques. The surgical report should mention the use of neuronavigation and any other intraoperative monitoring modalities, such as electrophysiological monitoring, to guide the surgical procedure and ensure the safety of critical structures.\n\n5. Insufficient information on hemostasis and closure techniques. The surgical report should provide details on the methods used to achieve hemostasis, such as the use of bipolar electrocoagulation and gelatin sponge. Additionally, the closure of the dura mater and scalp should be described in more detail, including the suture technique and materials used.\n\n6. Incomplete information on postoperative care and follow-up. The surgical report should include information on the postoperative management of the patient, such as pain control, antibiotic prophylaxis, and plans for postoperative imaging and follow-up visits.\n\nOverall, the surgical report needs to provide more comprehensive and detailed information about the surgical procedure, including preoperative evaluation, tumor characteristics, intraoperative monitoring, hemostasis and closure techniques, and postoperative care. This will ensure a more accurate and informative documentation of the surgery.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped, with iodine used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips.\n- The nasal mucosa was contracted using a cotton pad soaked in 1ml of adrenaline solution for 5 minutes.\n- A nasal endoscope was used to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings, and the right middle turbinate was pushed laterally.\n- The sphenoid sinus opening was then opened using a monopolar electrocautery, extending from the sphenoid ostium to the posterior nasal aperture, exposing the bony nasal septum.\n- A high-speed drill was used to remove the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The removed bone fragment was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n- The bone septum was removed using the drill, and a microdrill was used to further enlarge the sellar floor window to 1.3cm x 1.0cm.\n- The dura mater of the sellar floor was carefully incised using a microhook knife, and dark red fluid was observed to flow out. Tumor tissue with a soft, gray-white appearance was visible in the sellar and suprasellar regions, with no clear capsule.\n- The medial walls of the cavernous sinuses were intact, and the sellar septum was intact.\n- The tumor was completely resected, with no involvement of the surrounding pituitary gland.\n- Tumor specimens were collected using forceps, and the tumor cavity was carefully scraped using various sizes of curettes.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n- The surgical site was inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and none was found.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater.\n- The nasal cavities were packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery was successful, with a total surgical time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n- The resected tumor measured approximately 23x19x17mm^3, and a portion was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation: The surgical report should include more specific details, such as the type of anesthesia used, the specific instruments and equipment utilized, and the specific steps taken during the procedure. This will provide a more comprehensive overview of the surgery.\n\n2. Inconsistent terminology: The report uses different terms to describe the same structures and procedures. It is important to use standardized terminology to ensure clarity and accuracy in the report.\n\n3. Inadequate description of tumor characteristics: The report does not provide sufficient information about the tumor, such as its location, histological type, and grade. This information is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment planning.\n\n4. Lack of post-operative care details: The report does not mention any post-operative measures, such as the use of antibiotics, pain management, or follow-up plans. Including this information is essential for comprehensive patient care.\n\n5. Incomplete description of hemostasis: The report does not provide details about the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery. It is important to document any specific techniques or materials used to achieve hemostasis.\n\n6. Absence of complications or adverse events: The report does not mention any complications or adverse events that occurred during the surgery. It is important to document any complications, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or intraoperative bleeding, for accurate assessment and future reference.\n\n7. Lack of specific recommendations: The report does not provide specific recommendations for further management or follow-up. It is important to include recommendations for post-operative care, such as imaging studies or referral to other specialists, if necessary.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks specific details, consistency in terminology, and comprehensive documentation of the surgical procedure. Improving these aspects will enhance the quality and usefulness of the report for future reference and patient care.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, and the nasal cavity and lips are disinfected with iodine solution. Cotton pads soaked in 1ml of adrenaline are used to shrink the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes. The bilateral sphenoid sinus openings are explored using a neuroendoscope, and the right middle turbinate is pushed laterally. The sphenoid sinus opening is then opened using a monopolar electrocautery, extending to the posterior nasal aperture to expose the bony nasal septum. The ethmoidal sinus is then accessed using a high-speed drill, and a bone window measuring 1.5cm X 1.5cm is created on the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus. The bone fragment from the lateral wall is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The bone septum within the sphenoid sinus is removed using the drill. The sellar floor bone window is further enlarged to 1.3cm X 1.0cm using a microdrill, and the dura mater of the sellar floor is carefully incised using a microhook knife. A soft, grayish-white tumor tissue is visible on the left wing of the pituitary gland, with poor blood supply and clear tumor boundaries. The tumor is not encapsulated, and the medial walls of the cavernous sinuses are intact. The tumor is completely resected, with partial resection of the pituitary gland. The tumor cavity is rinsed with saline, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. There is no cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. The nasal cavities are packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery proceeds smoothly, with a total surgical time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml. The patient is extubated and safely transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room. A tumor specimen measuring approximately 6\u00d75\u00d75mm3 is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n1. The surgical report lacks details regarding the positioning of the patient and the use of a head frame. It is important to provide specific information about the patient's position and any additional equipment used during the surgery.\n   - Suggestion: Include details about the patient's position, such as the use of a head frame and the specific angle of head elevation.\n\n2. The report does not mention the use of neuronavigation for tumor localization. Neuronavigation is a valuable tool in accurately identifying the tumor's location and guiding the surgical approach.\n   - Suggestion: Include information about the use of neuronavigation for tumor localization and outlining the tumor's projection on the body surface.\n\n3. The report does not mention the use of intraoperative ultrasound for tumor assessment. Intraoperative ultrasound can provide real-time imaging of the tumor and aid in determining its extent and characteristics.\n   - Suggestion: Include information about the use of intraoperative ultrasound for tumor assessment and any findings or observations made during the procedure.\n\n4. The report does not provide details about the closure of the surgical site, such as the specific suturing technique used for the dural resection edge and the type of artificial dura mater used.\n   - Suggestion: Include information about the suturing technique used for the dural resection edge and the specific type of artificial dura mater used for closure.\n\n5. The report does not mention the use of any hemostatic agents or techniques during the surgery. Hemostasis is crucial to prevent excessive bleeding and ensure a successful surgical outcome.\n   - Suggestion: Include information about the use of hemostatic agents or techniques, such as bipolar electrocoagulation or the application of hemostatic materials, to achieve hemostasis during the surgery.\n\n6. The report does not provide information about the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and specific instructions for recovery.\n   - Suggestion: Include details about the postoperative care plan, including pain management strategies, wound care instructions, and any specific instructions for the patient's recovery.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could benefit from providing a more comprehensive overview of the surgical procedure and postoperative care plan.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the operating table in a head-up, feet-down position. The surgical field is prepared by disinfecting the nasal cavity and lips with iodine solution. Nasal mucosa is then decongested using cotton soaked in 1ml of adrenaline for 5 minutes. \n\nThe surgeon performs a neuroendoscopic exploration of the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings, pushing the right middle turbinate laterally. The sphenoid sinus opening is then enlarged using a monopolar electrocautery until the posterior nasal aperture is reached, exposing the bony nasal septum. The anterior wall of the sphenoid sinus is then drilled using a high-speed drill, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the anterior wall is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The bony septum within the sphenoid sinus is also removed using the drill. \n\nThe surgeon further enlarges the sellar floor bone window using a microdrill, reaching a size of 1.3cm x 1.0cm. The dura mater of the sellar floor is carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing the tumor tissue within the sella, the cavernous sinus, and the suprasellar region. The tumor tissue is grayish-white in color, with poor blood supply, clear boundaries, and no pseudocapsule. Tissue samples are taken using forceps, and the tumor within the sella is carefully scraped using various sizes of curettes. \n\nThe medial walls of the bilateral cavernous sinuses and the sellar septum are intact. The tumor is completely resected, and any tumor invasion into the bone is removed using a high-speed drill. The tumor cavity is irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. The surgical field is thoroughly inspected, and no cerebrospinal fluid leakage is detected. \n\nThe sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. Nasal cotton is then packed into the right nasal cavity and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery is completed successfully, with a total operating time of 2 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A portion of the resected tumor is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the positioning of the patient and the use of a head frame. It is important to provide specific details on patient positioning and the use of any necessary equipment to ensure accurate documentation and reproducibility of the surgical procedure.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical approach and incision. The report should include information on the specific incision used, such as a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision, to provide a clear understanding of the surgical approach.\n\n3. Insufficient information on the use of neuronavigation and intraoperative ultrasound. These technologies play a crucial role in guiding the surgical procedure and should be described in detail to highlight their importance in achieving accurate tumor resection.\n\n4. Lack of information on the use of electrophysiological monitoring. Electrophysiological monitoring is essential for identifying functional areas and avoiding damage to critical structures. It should be mentioned in the report to demonstrate adherence to standard surgical practices.\n\n5. Incomplete description of the tumor resection process. The report should provide more details on the techniques used for tumor resection, such as the use of suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors, to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the surgical steps.\n\n6. Absence of information on the closure of the surgical site and postoperative care. The report should include details on the closure of the dural resection edge, the use of artificial dura mater, and the placement of a drainage tube to provide a complete overview of the surgical procedure and postoperative management.\n\nOverall, the surgical report provided lacks some important details and does not fully adhere to the standard surgical process. It is recommended to revise the report by including the missing information and providing a more comprehensive description of the surgical steps and techniques used.",

Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this. The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding; the skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling. At this time, the meningeal tension is slightly higher, and dural suspension is performed. After intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, the dura mater was incised radially. Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed that there was a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of \u200b\u200bthe temporoparietal area. Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep. The rapid freezing pathology may indicate that it is a high-grade glioma.

Lack of detailed information on the surgical approach and technique used for the sellar floor reconstruction. It would be beneficial to provide more specific details on the steps taken during the reconstruction, such as the use of bone grafts or other materials.\n\n2. Inadequate documentation of the tumor characteristics and pathology findings. It is important to include information on the tumor's location, size, and histopathological diagnosis for a comprehensive surgical report.\n\n3. Limited information on the intraoperative monitoring and navigation techniques used. Including details on the use of neuronavigation, ultrasound, and electrophysiological monitoring would provide a more complete picture of the surgical procedure.\n\n4. Lack of information on post-operative complications and their management. It would be helpful to document any complications that occurred during the surgery, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or infection, and describe the interventions taken to address them.\n\n5. Insufficient documentation of the closure technique and wound care. Providing information on the closure of the surgical site, including the use of sutures or other closure methods, as well as the post-operative wound care instructions, would enhance the surgical report.\n\nOverall, the surgical report could be improved by providing more detailed information on the surgical technique, tumor characteristics, intraoperative monitoring, post-operative complications, and wound closure. This would ensure a more comprehensive and standardized surgical report.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, with iodine used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips. Cotton soaked with 1ml of adrenaline is applied to the nasal mucosa to shrink the nasal turbinate. The surgeon then performs nasal endoscopy to explore the nasal cavity and assess the extent of the lesion. The nasal mucosa is incised using a monopolar electrocautery, exposing the bony nasal septum. The surgeon proceeds to explore the sphenoid sinus, where significant scar tissue is observed. The scar tissue is removed using Kerrison rongeurs, revealing thickened bone at the base of the sella turcica. A high-speed drill is used to create a bone tunnel measuring approximately 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The surgeon then performs a puncture to locate the base of the sella turcica and carefully incises the dura mater using a microhook knife. A cystic lesion is observed within the sella and is drained, releasing clear fluid. The cyst wall is found to be adhered to blood vessels and is not further dissected. The medial walls of the cavernous sinuses are intact. The tumor cavity is irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. The sellar floor is reconstructed using artificial dura mater and bone grafts. The surgical site is inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and the nasal cavity is packed with nasal tampons and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery proceeds smoothly, with a total surgical time of 1.5 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n\n1. Lack of detailed description of the tumor characteristics: The surgical report does not provide specific information about the nature of the tumor, such as its size, location, and histopathological diagnosis. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan and prognosis.\n\n2. Incomplete documentation of intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or neuronavigation. These techniques are important for ensuring the safety and accuracy of the surgical procedure.\n\n3. Insufficient information on postoperative care: The report does not provide details about the postoperative care and monitoring of the patient, such as pain management, wound care, and follow-up plans. This information is essential for ensuring the patient's recovery and preventing complications.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Include detailed information about the tumor characteristics, such as its size, location, and histopathological diagnosis. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of the tumor and guide further treatment decisions.\n\n2. Document the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring and neuronavigation. This will demonstrate the surgeon's adherence to standard practices and ensure the accuracy and safety of the procedure.\n\n3. Provide a thorough description of the postoperative care and monitoring plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up plans. This will ensure the patient's optimal recovery and reduce the risk of complications.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks important details and documentation, which may affect the accuracy and completeness of the surgical record. It is important to ensure that all relevant information is included in the report to maintain the highest standard of surgical care.",

The right frontal, right parietal, midline of the chest, and left lateral abdominal rectus muscle incision lines are marked. The surgical field is sterilized and drapes are placed. A 3cm incision is made on the right side of the midline of the forehead, 10cm above the eyebrow arch, and the scalp is incised down to the skull. A mastoid retractor is used to retract the scalp. A single hole is drilled in the skull. A 3cm incision is made on the top of the head and a 1cm incision is made on the chest. The distal end of the top incision is expanded subcutaneously to form a potential wide subcutaneous tunnel, approximately 2cm\u00d76cm in size. A 3cm incision is made on the left side of the umbilicus and the abdominal incision is made to the level of the peritone",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly tilted back and the surgical bed in a head-up, feet-down position. The surgical field is sterilized and draped with towels. The nasal cavity and lips are disinfected with iodine solution. Cotton soaked with 1ml of adrenaline is used to shrink the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes. The bilateral sphenoid sinus openings are explored using a neuroendoscope. The right middle turbinate is pushed outward, and the sphenoid sinus opening is opened using a monopolar electrocautery. The opening is extended to the posterior nasal cavity, exposing the bony nasal septum. The sphenoid sinus floor is then drilled using a high-speed drill, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the sphenoid sinus floor is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The bony septum inside the sphenoid sinus is removed using the drill. The sellar floor bone window is further enlarged using a microdrill to a size of 1.3cm x 1.0cm. The dura mater of the sellar floor is carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue in the sella and suprasellar region. The tumor is well-defined, without a pseudocapsule. The medial walls of the bilateral cavernous sinuses are intact, as well as the sellar septum. The tumor is completely resected, with partial resection of the pituitary gland. Tissue samples are taken for pathological examination. The tumor cavity is irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. Careful inspection confirms no cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. Nasal cotton is packed in both nasal cavities and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery is successful, with a total operation time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room. A tumor measuring approximately 12x11x11mm^3 is resected, and a portion is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n1. Lack of detailed description of the surgical approach and positioning of the patient.\n2. Incomplete description of the steps involved in the tumor resection, such as the use of neuronavigation and intraoperative ultrasound.\n3. Insufficient information on the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery.\n4. Lack of information on the closure of the surgical site and post-operative care.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n1. Provide a more detailed description of the surgical approach, including the specific positioning of the patient and the use of any specialized equipment or techniques.\n2. Include a step-by-step description of the tumor resection, highlighting the use of neuronavigation and intraoperative ultrasound for guidance.\n3. Describe the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery, such as the use of bipolar electrocoagulation or other techniques to control bleeding.\n4. Provide information on the closure of the surgical site, including the suturing technique used and any additional measures taken to ensure proper wound healing.\n5. Include details on the post-operative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and monitoring of vital signs.\n\nOverall, the surgical report provided lacks sufficient detail and organization. It is recommended to revise and provide a more comprehensive and standardized report following the standard surgical process.",

Lack of detailed information on the patient's preoperative condition, such as the reason for the surgery and any relevant medical history. It is important to include this information in the surgical report for a comprehensive understanding of the case.\n\n2. Incomplete documentation of the tumor characteristics, such as its location, size, and histopathological diagnosis. Providing these details would enhance the clarity of the surgical report.\n\n3. Limited information on the intraoperative monitoring and navigation techniques used during the surgery. Including details on the specific monitoring modalities and their findings would be beneficial.\n\n4. Insufficient description of the closure and wound management procedures. It is important to provide information on the closure technique, use of drains, and postoperative wound care instructions.\n\n5. Lack of information on the patient's postoperative course, including their recovery, any complications, and follow-up plans. Including this information would provide a more comprehensive overview of the patient's surgical journey.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some essential details and could be improved by providing a more comprehensive and detailed account of the surgical procedure, patient information, and postoperative course.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia took effect, the patient was placed in a supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical bed in a head-up, feet-down position. The surgical field was prepared by disinfecting the nasal cavity and lips with iodine solution. Nasal tampons soaked in a solution containing 1ml of adrenaline were used to shrink the nasal turbinates for 5 minutes. \n\nThe surgical procedure began with the use of a nasal endoscope to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings. The right middle turbinate was pushed laterally, and a unipolar electrocautery was used to open the sphenoid sinus opening up to the posterior nasal aperture, exposing the bony nasal septum. A high-speed drill was then used to remove the bony wall of the sphenoid sinus, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm X 1.5cm. The removed bone fragment was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n\nUpon further exploration, a bony septum was observed within the sphenoid sinus, which was also removed using the drill. The bone window at the sellar floor was then enlarged to 1.3cm X 1.0cm using a microdrill. Careful dissection with a microhook knife allowed for the incision of the dura mater at the sellar floor, revealing liquefied, gray-white tissue with some crystals. The contents of the cyst were aspirated, and the integrity of the bilateral medial walls of the cavernous sinuses and the presence of arachnoid membranes above were confirmed. The sellar septum was intact. Tissue samples of the tumor were obtained using forceps, and the tumor within the sella was carefully scraped using various sizes of curettes. The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue was observed. A thorough examination revealed no cerebrospinal fluid leakage.\n\nThe sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater and hydroxyapatite. The nasal cavities were packed with nasal tampons and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery was successful, with a total surgical time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery. A tumor measuring approximately 16\u00d721\u00d717mm3 was resected during the surgery, and a portion of it was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n1.

Inconsistent positioning: The surgical report mentions that the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, but the standard surgical procedure states that the patient should be placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table in a head-down position. It is important to ensure consistency in the positioning of the patient to avoid confusion and potential errors during surgery. \n\n2. Lack of detailed description: The surgical report lacks detailed descriptions of certain steps, such as the use of neuronavigation registration, the specific technique used for dural suspension, and the method of dural closure. Providing more specific details in the surgical report can help improve clarity and understanding of the procedure.\n\n3. Inadequate documentation of hemostasis: The surgical report does not provide sufficient information regarding hemostasis techniques used during the procedure. It is important to document the specific methods employed to achieve hemostasis, such as the use of bipolar electrocoagulation or other hemostatic agents. This information is crucial for future reference and evaluation of the surgical outcome.\n\n4. Lack of documentation of postoperative care: The surgical report does not mention the postoperative care provided to the patient, such as pain management, wound care, and monitoring of vital signs. It is essential to document the postoperative care plan and any specific instructions given to ensure proper recovery and minimize complications.\n\n5. Incomplete documentation of specimen handling: The surgical report mentions that a tumor specimen was sent for pathological examination, but it does not provide details on how the specimen was collected, labeled, and transported. It is important to document the proper handling of specimens to ensure accurate pathological analysis and avoid any potential errors or misinterpretations.\n\nOverall, the surgical report has some inconsistencies and lacks certain important details. Improvements can be made by ensuring consistency in positioning, providing more specific descriptions of the surgical steps, documenting hemostasis techniques, including postoperative care information, and providing detailed documentation of specimen handling.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame after anesthesia.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised sequentially.\n- Scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially after intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- The anterior tumor invading the posterior limb of the internal capsule was not resected.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- The systolic blood pressure increased to the entrance blood pressure, indicating satisfactory hemostasis.\n- The ventricle and surgical field were flushed, and a drainage tube was placed.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n- The bleeding during the operation was approximately 100ml, and no blood transfusion was performed.\n- The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the tumor's location and characteristics: It would be beneficial to provide more specific details about the tumor's location, size, and characteristics to aid in understanding the surgical approach and potential challenges.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the tumor resection process: The report should include more information about the techniques used for tumor resection, such as the use of intraoperative imaging, the extent of tumor removal, and any difficulties encountered during the procedure.\n\n3. Limited information on postoperative care: The report should mention the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up appointments.\n\n4. Lack of information on complications or adverse events: It is important to document any complications or adverse events that occurred during the surgery, as well as the steps taken to address them.\n\n5. Insufficient details on hemostasis: The report should provide more information on the methods used for hemostasis, such as the use of hemostatic agents or sutures, to ensure adequate control of bleeding.\n\n6. Incomplete documentation of the closure process: The report should include a detailed description of the closure process, including the type of sutures used and the technique employed to achieve a secure closure.\n\n7. Lack of information on the patient's postoperative condition: It would be helpful to include information on the patient's immediate postoperative condition, such as vital signs, neurological status, and any immediate postoperative complications.\n\n8. Inadequate documentation of the specimen handling: The report should mention the proper handling and labeling of the specimen for pathological examination, including any specific instructions given to the pathology department.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some essential details and should be more comprehensive in describing the surgical procedure, postoperative care, and patient outcomes. Providing more specific information and addressing the shortcomings mentioned above would improve the quality and completeness of the report.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia was completed, the patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field was prepared and draped using standard techniques, including the use of iodine solution for nasal and lip disinfection. The nasal mucosa was then decongested using cotton soaked in a solution containing 1ml of adrenaline. The surgeon performed a nasal endoscopy to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings and pushed the right middle turbinate laterally. The sphenoid sinus opening was then opened using a monopolar electrocautery, extending from the sphenoid ostium to the posterior nasal aperture, exposing the bony nasal septum. A high-speed drill was used to remove the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm X 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the lateral wall was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The bone septum within the sphenoid sinus was also removed using the drill. The drill was then used under microscopic guidance to further enlarge the sellar floor and the tuberculum sellae, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm X 1.3cm. Careful dissection with a microhook knife allowed for the opening of the sellar dura mater, revealing a cystic lesion within the sella and suprasellar region. The cystic lesion contained clear fluid and had thin walls. After careful dissection of the cystic wall, the cystic cavity was irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue was observed. The Liliequist membrane and the basilar artery were visible in the deep region, while the floor of the third ventricle was visible above. Autologous fat and fascia were harvested from the patient's left thigh and used for repair. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were sutured layer by layer. An artificial dura mater was placed over the sellar and suprasellar regions, and the autologous fascia and fat were packed within the sella. A mucosal flap was used to cover the surface of the fascia, and iodine-soaked gauze was applied for compression. No cerebrospinal fluid leakage was observed. Nasal packing was performed bilaterally, and sterile dressings were applied. The surgery proceeded smoothly, with a total duration of 2 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient was extubated and safely transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A tumor measuring approximately 14\u00d722\u00d718mm3 was resected during the operation, and a portion of it was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the patient's preoperative condition, including relevant medical history, imaging findings, and preoperative evaluation. It is important to include this information in the surgical report to provide a comprehensive understanding of the case and aid in future reference.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical approach and technique. The report should provide more specific details on the steps taken during the surgery, such as the use of neuronavigation, the specific instruments used, and the sequence of the surgical maneuvers.\n\n3. Limited information on intraoperative monitoring and assessment. It is essential to include details on the use of electrophysiological monitoring, intraoperative ultrasound, and neuronavigation to guide the surgical procedure and ensure patient safety.\n\n4. Insufficient information on the extent of tumor resection and the presence of any residual tumor tissue. The report should clearly state the extent of tumor removal and any findings regarding the presence of residual tumor tissue.\n\n5. Lack of information on postoperative care and follow-up plan. It is important to include details on the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications. Additionally, the report should mention the need for further imaging studies or follow-up appointments.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks specific details and comprehensive information on the surgical procedure, intraoperative findings, and postoperative care. Providing more detailed and accurate information in the report will improve its quality and usefulness for future reference and patient care.",

It was completely resected using various instruments, and the tumor specimen was collected for pathological examination.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n- The artificial dura mater was used to reconstruct the sella turcica.\n- Nasal cotton was placed bilaterally to prevent bleeding, and sterile dressings were applied.\n- The surgery lasted for 1 hour, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.\n- The tumor size was approximately 19x18x15mm^3, and a portion of it was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation: The surgical report lacks specific details regarding the steps taken during the surgery, such as the specific instruments used, the techniques employed, and the specific findings observed. It is important to provide a more comprehensive and detailed account of the surgical procedure for accurate documentation and future reference.\n\n2. Inconsistent terminology: The report uses different terms to describe the same anatomical structures, such as \"sella turcica\" and \"sphenoid sinus.\" It is important to use consistent and accurate terminology to ensure clarity and avoid confusion.\n\n3. Inadequate description of tumor characteristics: The report does not provide sufficient information about the tumor, such as its location within the sella turcica, its relationship to surrounding structures, and its histopathological features. A more detailed description of the tumor characteristics would provide valuable information for further analysis and treatment planning.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report does not mention any details about postoperative care, such as wound care, pain management, or follow-up instructions. It is essential to include this information to ensure proper patient care and recovery.\n\n5. Incomplete documentation of intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention any details about intraoperative monitoring, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. Including this information would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the surgical procedure and its outcomes.\n\nOverall, the surgical report needs improvement in terms of documentation, terminology, tumor description, postoperative care information, and inclusion of intraoperative monitoring details. These suggestions will help enhance the accuracy and completeness of the surgical report.",

The surgical field was prepared and draped, and the nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine. Cotton pads soaked in 1ml of epinephrine were used to shrink the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes.\n\n- Surgical Approach: The surgeon performed a bilateral endoscopic exploration of the sphenoid sinus. The right middle turbinate was pushed laterally, and the sphenoid sinus ostium was opened using a monopolar electrocautery. The surgeon then used a high-speed drill to enlarge the sphenoid sinus and create a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the sphenoid sinus was preserved for later repair.\n\n- Tumor Resection: The surgeon used a microscope and microdrill to further enlarge the sellar floor bone window to 1.3cm x 1.0cm. Careful dissection of the pituitary gland revealed a suspected tumor with limited blood supply and no capsule. The tumor was partially resected, and tissue samples were collected for pathological examination. The remaining tumor within the sellar cavity was carefully removed using various curettes. The cavity was irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n\n- Closure: The surgeon reconstructed the sellar floor using an artificial dura mater. The right nasal cavity was packed with gauze and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery was completed successfully, with a total duration of 1.5 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the patient's preoperative condition, such as the reason for surgery and any relevant medical history. It is important to include this information in the surgical report for a comprehensive understanding of the case.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the tumor characteristics, such as its size, location, and histopathological diagnosis. Providing more specific details about the tumor can help in assessing the extent of resection and planning further treatment.\n\n3. Limited information on intraoperative monitoring and navigation techniques used during the surgery. Including details about the use of neuronavigation, ultrasound, and electrophysiological monitoring can provide a better understanding of the surgical approach and decision-making process.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up plans. It is essential to outline the postoperative care instructions and schedule follow-up appointments to ensure proper healing and patient recovery.\n\n5. Insufficient information on complications, if any, encountered during the surgery and their management. Reporting any intraoperative complications and their resolution is crucial for evaluating the surgical outcome and identifying areas for improvement.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be more comprehensive in describing the surgical procedure, patient condition, and postoperative care. Providing a more detailed and standardized report will enhance communication among healthcare professionals and contribute to better patient care.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process:\n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table in a head-down position.\n- The surgical field was prepared and draped, with iodine used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips.\n- The nasal mucosa was shrunk using a cotton pad soaked in 1ml of adrenaline for 5 minutes.\n- The surgeon performed endoscopic exploration of the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings and used a monopolar electrocautery to open the sphenoid sinus opening.\n- The surgeon used a high-speed drill to remove the sphenoid sinus lateral wall and create a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm.\n- The bone window was enlarged using a microdrill to a size of 1.3cm x 1.0cm, and the surgeon carefully incised the sellar dura using a microhook knife.\n- The tumor tissue was observed within the sphenoid sinus and sellar region, with clear boundaries and no pseudocapsule.\n- The tumor was resected, and the sellar septum remained intact.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n- There was no cerebrospinal fluid leakage observed during the procedure.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater.\n- The nasal cavity was packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery lasted for 2 hours, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 400ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n- The surgical report lacks specific details about the tumor size, location, and histopathological findings. It is important to include these details for a comprehensive surgical report.\n- The report does not mention the use of neuronavigation or intraoperative ultrasound, which are commonly used in such surgeries. Including these details would provide a more accurate account of the surgical procedure.\n- The report does not mention the closure of the surgical incision or the use of sutures. It is important to include these details to ensure proper wound healing.\n- The report does not mention the post-operative care plan or any potential complications that may arise. It is important to provide this information for the patient's follow-up care.\n\nOverall, the surgical procedure was performed successfully, but the surgical report could be improved by including more specific details and addressing the shortcomings mentioned above.",

The sphenoid sinus was accessed through the nasal cavity, and the sella turcica was visualized. A small incision was made in the nasal cavity to expose the nasal septum, and a high-speed drill was used to create a bone window in the sphenoid sinus. The bone window was enlarged to approximately 1.5cm X 1.5cm, and the bone fragment was preserved for later repair. The tumor was identified and carefully dissected and removed. The surgical site was thoroughly inspected, and no residual tumor or bleeding was observed. \n\nThe dural defect was repaired using an artificial dura mater, and the nasal cavity was packed with sterile gauze. The surgery was completed successfully, with a total duration of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room for further monitoring and care. \n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation: The surgical report should include more specific details about the surgical technique used, such as the type of neuroendoscope and the specific steps taken during the tumor dissection. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the procedure for future reference.\n\n2. Inadequate description of tumor characteristics: The report does not provide sufficient information about the tumor, such as its location, size, and histopathological features. Including these details would help in evaluating the completeness of tumor removal and assessing the prognosis.\n\n3. Limited information on intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. These techniques are important for ensuring the safety and accuracy of the surgery and should be documented.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report does not mention the specific postoperative care measures taken, such as pain management, wound care, or follow-up plans. Including this information is essential for ensuring proper patient recovery and continuity of care.\n\n5. Absence of complications or challenges encountered: The report does not mention any complications or challenges encountered during the surgery. It is important to document any difficulties faced during the procedure, as well as the steps taken to overcome them, as this information can be valuable for future reference and learning.\n\nOverall, the surgical report should provide a more detailed and comprehensive account of the surgical procedure, including specific details about the tumor, intraoperative monitoring, postoperative care, and any complications or challenges encountered. This will ensure accurate documentation and facilitate better patient care and future surgical planning.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially after intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal area.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring showed that the anterior tumor invaded the posterior limb of the internal capsule, so it was not resected.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the type and grade of the tumor: It is important to provide specific information about the tumor, such as its histological type and grade, as this can impact the treatment plan and prognosis. It is recommended to include this information in the surgical report.\n\n2. Incomplete description of the extent of tumor resection: The report mentions subtotal resection of the lesion, but does not provide specific details about the remaining tumor tissue. It is important to accurately describe the extent of tumor resection, including any residual tumor tissue, as this can affect the need for further treatment or follow-up.\n\n3. Limited information on intraoperative monitoring: The report briefly mentions electrophysiological monitoring, but does not provide details on the specific parameters monitored or any abnormalities detected. It is important to include more information about the intraoperative monitoring techniques used and any relevant findings, as this can help assess the safety and efficacy of the procedure.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care and follow-up: The report does not mention the postoperative care plan or any plans for follow-up visits or imaging studies. It is important to include information on the postoperative care instructions given to the patient, any medications prescribed, and the recommended follow-up schedule.\n\n5. Inadequate documentation of blood loss and transfusion: The report mentions a blood loss of approximately 100ml, but does not provide information on whether any blood transfusion was performed. It is important to accurately document the amount of blood loss during the procedure and any transfusions given, as this can help assess the patient's overall condition and the need for additional interventions.\n\n6. Lack of information on complications or adverse events: The report does not mention any complications or adverse events that occurred during the surgery. It is important to document any complications or adverse events, such as intraoperative bleeding, injury to surrounding structures, or changes in neurological status, as this can help evaluate the safety and success of the procedure.\n\nOverall, the surgical report provides a general overview of the procedure, but lacks specific details and comprehensive documentation. It is recommended to improve the report by including more specific information about the tumor, the extent of resection, intraoperative monitoring, postoperative care, blood loss and transfusion, and any complications or adverse events.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially after intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep, and it was resected using suction, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm x 6cm x 6cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- A drainage tube was placed in the ventricle and the surgical field was flushed.\n- The patient was returned to the ward safely.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n\n- The surgical report lacks specific details about the tumor's location, size, and characteristics.\n- The report does not mention the type of tumor or the grade of glioma.\n- There is no mention of any preoperative imaging studies or diagnostic tests.\n- The report does not provide information about the patient's preoperative condition or any relevant medical history.\n- The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as neurophysiological monitoring or awake craniotomy.\n- There is no mention of any complications or unexpected events that occurred during the surgery.\n- The report does not provide information about the postoperative care plan or any follow-up recommendations.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n- Include specific details about the tumor, such as its location, size, and characteristics.\n- Provide information about the type of tumor and the grade of glioma.\n- Include details about any preoperative imaging studies or diagnostic tests.\n- Provide information about the patient's preoperative condition and relevant medical history.\n- Mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as neurophysiological monitoring or awake craniotomy.\n- Include information about any complications or unexpected events that occurred during the surgery.\n- Provide a postoperative care plan and any follow-up recommendations.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks important details and should be more comprehensive in order to accurately document the surgical procedure and provide a complete picture of the patient's condition and treatment.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped, with the nasal cavity and lips disinfected using iodine cotton swabs soaked in adrenaline and lidocaine.\n- The left nasal mucosa was separated under a surgical microscope, revealing a mildly deviated nasal septum.\n- The nasal septal cartilage was pushed to the right side, and a nasal septal retractor was inserted to expose the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus.\n- The sphenoid sinus was visualized, showing a fully saddle-shaped appearance with irregular septations.\n- The irregular septations within the sphenoid sinus were removed, and the sellar floor was found to be mildly enlarged and depressed, with thinning of the bone but no obvious destruction or defect.\n- A bone window measuring approximately 1.0x1.0cm2 was created in the sellar floor, revealing intact dura mater with high tension.\n- A fine needle was used to puncture the dura mater, and gray-white tumor tissue was observed to ooze out from the sellar region.\n- The tumor tissue was carefully dissected using tissue forceps and a microscraping spoon, and the tumor size was approximately 1.2x1.0x0.7cm3.\n- The resected tumor specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n- After tumor resection, the sellar diaphragm completely descended to the sellar floor level.\n- No cerebrospinal fluid leakage was observed, and the tumor bed was thoroughly irrigated with saline to confirm no active bleeding or residual foreign bodies.\n- The sellar floor and intrasellar region were packed with a few strands of Surgicel, and the artificial dura mater was properly repaired.\n- The sphenoid sinus was covered with collagen sponge, and the nasal septal retractor was removed.\n- Two absorbable cotton strips were placed in the nasal cavity, and the surgery was completed with minimal bleeding and no blood transfusion.\n- The patient was extubated and safely transferred to the anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the patient's preoperative condition, such as the specific symptoms and diagnostic findings.\n   - It is important to include relevant preoperative information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition and the rationale for the surgical approach.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the tumor characteristics, such as its location, consistency, and vascularity.\n   - Providing more detailed information about the tumor characteristics can help in understanding the complexity of the surgery and the potential challenges encountered.\n\n3. Limited information on the intraoperative monitoring and navigation techniques used.\n   - It is essential to mention the specific monitoring and navigation techniques employed during the surgery, as they play a crucial role in ensuring accurate tumor resection and minimizing damage to surrounding structures.\n\n4. Lack of information on the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up.\n   - It is important to outline the postoperative care plan, including pain management strategies, wound care protocols, and the frequency and duration of follow-up visits, to ensure optimal recovery and long-term outcomes for the patient.\n\n5. Insufficient details on the amount of bleeding and the use of hemostatic measures.\n   - Providing specific information on the amount of bleeding during the surgery and the hemostatic measures employed can help in assessing the adequacy of hemostasis and the potential risk of postoperative complications.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more comprehensive information on the patient's condition, tumor characteristics, intraoperative techniques, postoperative care plan, and specific measures taken to ensure patient safety and optimal outcomes.",

The removed bone fragment was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n- The surgeon then removed the bony septum at the sellar floor using a microdrill, enlarging the sellar floor window to 1.3cm x 1.0cm.\n- Careful dissection with a microhook knife allowed the surgeon to open the dura mater at the sellar floor, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue in the sella and suprasellar region.\n- Tissue samples were taken for pathological examination, and various sizes of curettes were used to remove the tumor tissue within the sella.\n- The sellar floor was intact after complete tumor resection, and no residual tumor tissue was observed along the sellar septum.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution, and no cerebrospinal fluid leakage was detected.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater, and nasal packing was placed in both nasal cavities and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery was completed successfully with a total surgical time of 1.5 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml.\n- The resected tumor measured approximately 49mm x 30mm x 35mm, and a portion of it was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the tumor characteristics: The surgical report does not provide specific details about the tumor, such as its location, histological type, or grade.

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame after anesthesia.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galea aponeurosis were incised in sequence, with scalp clips used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially after intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region.\n- Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, the tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the tumor characteristics and location: It would be beneficial to provide more specific details about the tumor, such as its histological type, grade, and precise location within the brain.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical technique: The report should include more specific information about the surgical technique used for tumor resection, such as the use of microsurgical instruments, the approach to blood vessels, and the preservation of critical structures.\n\n3. Limited information on intraoperative monitoring: It would be helpful to mention the specific intraoperative monitoring techniques used, such as motor and sensory evoked potentials, to ensure the safety of critical neural structures during the surgery.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report should include details about the postoperative care provided to the patient, such as pain management, antibiotic administration, and follow-up imaging studies.\n\n5. Insufficient documentation of blood loss and transfusion: The report should provide accurate documentation of blood loss during the surgery and whether any blood transfusion was performed.\n\n6. Incomplete information on pathological examination: The report should mention the results of the pathological examination of the resected tumor, including the final diagnosis and any relevant findings.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more specific information about the surgical technique, intraoperative monitoring, postoperative care, and pathological examination.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The nasal cavity and lips were disinfected using iodine solution.\n- Absorbable sutures were used to shrink the nasal turbinates.\n- A nasal endoscope was used to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings.\n- The right middle turbinate was pushed laterally, and a monopolar electrocautery was used to open the sphenoid sinus opening.\n- The sphenoid sinus was further opened using a high-speed drill, and a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm was created.\n- The bone window was enlarged using a microdrill to a size of 1.3cm x 1.0cm.\n- The dura mater at the sellar floor was carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue.\n- The tumor was completely resected, and tumor specimens were collected for pathological examination.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater.\n- The nasal cavities were packed with nasal tampons and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery lasted for 1.5 hours, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation: The surgical report lacks specific details about the surgical technique used, such as the specific instruments and equipment utilized during the procedure. It is important to provide a comprehensive description of the surgical steps and techniques employed.\n\n2. Incomplete documentation of tumor characteristics: The report does not provide sufficient information about the tumor, such as its size, location, and histopathological diagnosis. It is crucial to include these details for accurate documentation and future reference.\n\n3. Inadequate description of hemostasis: The report does not mention the specific methods used for hemostasis during the procedure. It is important to document the techniques employed to control bleeding and ensure adequate hemostasis.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report does not mention the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up instructions. It is essential to provide clear instructions for postoperative care to ensure optimal recovery and minimize complications.\n\n5. Absence of intraoperative monitoring details: The report does not mention any intraoperative monitoring techniques used, such as electrophysiological monitoring or neuronavigation. It is important to document the use of these techniques to ensure accurate and safe tumor resection.\n\n6. Incomplete documentation of complications: The report does not mention any complications encountered during the surgery. It is important to document any intraoperative complications, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or vascular injury, for accurate reporting and future reference.\n\nOverall, the surgical report needs improvement in terms of detailed documentation, inclusion of tumor characteristics, description of hemostasis techniques, documentation of postoperative care, inclusion of intraoperative monitoring details, and reporting of complications. These suggestions will help enhance the accuracy and completeness of the surgical report.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, with iodine used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips. Cotton soaked with 1ml of adrenaline is applied to the nasal cavity to shrink the nasal mucosa. The surgical team then proceeds with the surgery as follows:\n\n1. Bilateral sphenoid sinus opening: The surgeon uses a neuroendoscope to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings. The right middle turbinate is pushed laterally, and the sphenoid sinus opening is accessed using a monopolar electrocautery. The opening is extended to the posterior nasal aperture, exposing the bony nasal septum.\n\n2. Sphenoid sinus wall removal: The surgeon uses a high-speed drill to remove the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The removed bone fragment is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n\n3. Tumor resection: The surgeon uses a microscope and a microdrill to further enlarge the sellar floor bone window to 1.3cm x 1.0cm. Carefully using a microhook knife, the surgeon opens the dura mater at the sellar floor, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue. The tumor is clearly identified, without a pseudocapsule. The tumor is completely resected, with partial resection of the surrounding pituitary tissue. Tumor specimens are collected using forceps, and the remaining tumor tissue within the sellar cavity is carefully scraped using various sizes of curettes. The tumor cavity is then irrigated with normal saline, and no residual tumor tissue is observed.\n\n4. Dural reconstruction: The surgeon reconstructs the sellar floor using an artificial dura mater. The nasal cavity is packed with cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n\n5. Surgical completion: The surgery is completed successfully, with a total duration of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 200ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit for recovery.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the tumor characteristics: The surgical report does not provide specific details about the tumor, such as its size, location, or histopathological diagnosis. This information is crucial for understanding the nature of the tumor and planning further treatment.\n\n2. Inadequate documentation of intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. These techniques are important for ensuring the safety and accuracy of the surgery.\n\n3. Insufficient description of hemostasis and closure: The report does not provide detailed information on the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery or the closure techniques used to secure the dura mater and the surgical incisions. This information is important for assessing the adequacy of hemostasis and wound closure.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Include detailed tumor characteristics: The surgical report should include specific details about the tumor, such as its size, location, and histopathological diagnosis. This information is essential for accurate documentation and future reference.\n\n2. Document the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques: The report should mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. This information is important for assessing the safety and accuracy of the surgery.\n\n3. Provide a comprehensive description of hemostasis and closure: The report should include a detailed description of the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery, as well as the closure techniques used to secure the dura mater and the surgical incisions. This information is crucial for evaluating the adequacy of hemostasis and wound closure.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and documentation, which may affect the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the surgical record. It is recommended to improve the documentation process to ensure a more thorough and standardized surgical report.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia was completed, the patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field was prepared and draped using standard techniques, including the use of iodine-based antiseptic solution for nasal and oral disinfection. The nasal mucosa was further decongested using cotton soaked in a solution containing 1ml of adrenaline. \n\nThe surgical approach involved the use of a neuroendoscope to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings. The right middle turbinate was gently pushed laterally, and the sphenoid sinus opening was accessed using a monopolar electrocautery. The opening was extended to the posterior nasal cavity, exposing the bony nasal septum. A high-speed drill was used to create a 1.5cm x 1.5cm bone window in the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, with the removed bone fragment reserved for later repair. The bone septum was also removed using the drill. \n\nA microscope was then used to further enlarge the sellar floor bone window to a size of 1.3cm x 1.0cm. Careful dissection of the sellar dura revealed a soft, grayish-white tumor in the right pituitary gland, with clear margins and no pseudocapsule. The tumor was completely resected, with partial resection of the surrounding pituitary tissue. Tumor specimens were collected using various sizes of curettes. The sellar cavity was thoroughly irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue was observed. \n\nThe sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater, and the nasal cavities were packed with sterile gauze. The surgery proceeded smoothly, with a total operating time of 2 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 200ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room without any complications. A portion of the resected tumor was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Inadequate description of the patient positioning and surgical field preparation: The surgical report should provide more details on the specific positioning of the patient and the steps taken to ensure a sterile surgical field. This information is important for maintaining patient safety and preventing surgical site infections. \n\nSuggestion: Include information on the specific positioning device used, the use of sterile drapes, and the steps taken to ensure aseptic technique during the surgery.\n\n2. Lack of information on intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. These techniques are important for ensuring the safety and accuracy of the surgical procedure.\n\nSuggestion: Include information on the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging, and their findings during the surgery.\n\n3. Incomplete description of hemostasis and closure: The report briefly mentions the use of bipolar electrocoagulation and the placement of gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze for hemostasis. However, it does not provide details on the specific techniques used for hemostasis or the closure of the surgical site.\n\nSuggestion: Provide a more detailed description of the hemostasis techniques used, including the specific steps taken to achieve hemostasis and the closure of the surgical site.\n\n4.

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is sterilized and draped, and the nasal cavity and lips are disinfected with iodine cotton swabs soaked in adrenaline and lidocaine. The left nasal mucosa is separated under the surgical microscope, revealing a mild deviation of the nasal septum. The nasal septal cartilage is pushed to the right side, and a nasal septal retractor is inserted to expose the medial wall of the sphenoid sinus. The sphenoid sinus is observed to be saddle-shaped, with irregular septations inside, which are removed. The sella floor is mildly enlarged and depressed, with intact bone quality but obvious thinning. A bone window is created in the sella floor, approximately 1.0x1.0cm^2 in size, to expose the dura mater. The dura mater is intact with high tension. A fine needle is used for puncture, but no fluid is extracted. The dura mater is radially incised with a small hook knife, and gray-white tumor tissue is seen flowing out from the sella. The tumor tissue is uneven in texture, mostly tough, and has rich blood supply. The tumor is carefully dissected using tissue forceps and microscrapers. Partial pituitary tissue on the surface of the sella and the right wall of the sella can be seen to be compressed and thinned, and are protected properly. The size of the resected tumor is approximately 1.2x1.0x0.7cm^3. The resected specimen is sent for pathological examination. As the tumor is removed, the sella floor completely descends to the level of the sella. No cerebrospinal fluid leakage is observed during the surgery. The tumor bed is repeatedly flushed with saline to confirm no active bleeding or residual foreign bodies. A few strands of Surgicel are placed in the sella floor and the dura mater is properly repaired. The sphenoid sinus is covered with collagen sponge, and the nasal septal retractor is removed. Two absorbable cotton strips are placed in the nasal cavity for packing. The surgery is smooth with minimal bleeding, and no blood transfusion is required. The patient is extubated and safely returned to the anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n1. Lack of detailed information on the preoperative preparation, such as the specific sterilization process and the type of anesthesia used.\n2. Incomplete description of the surgical approach and incision site.\n3. Insufficient information on the intraoperative monitoring and navigation techniques used.\n4. Lack of information on the closure of the surgical site, including the type of sutures used and the method of wound closure.\n5. Inadequate documentation of the amount of bleeding and the use of hemostatic measures.\n6. Missing information on the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up appointments.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Provide a detailed description of the preoperative preparation, including the sterilization process and the type of anesthesia used.\n2. Clearly state the surgical approach and incision site, including any specific landmarks or anatomical structures involved.\n3. Include information on the intraoperative monitoring and navigation techniques used, such as neuronavigation or intraoperative ultrasound.\n4. Describe the closure of the surgical site in detail, including the type of sutures used and the method of wound closure.\n5. Document the amount of bleeding during the operation and the use of hemostatic measures, such as electrocautery or hemostatic agents.\n6. Provide information on the postoperative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up appointments.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame after anesthesia was completed.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped as usual.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galea aponeurosis were incised in sequence, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially under the guidance of intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep, and rapid freezing pathology indicated a high-grade glioma.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors, gradually going deep into the blood vessels.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm, with the triangular area of the lateral ventricle open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze for further hemostasis.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward with no blood transfusion performed.\n- The bleeding during the operation was approximately 100ml, and a specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n\n- The surgical report lacks specific details about the steps taken during the surgery, such as the specific instruments used and the techniques employed.\n- The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative imaging guidance, such as neuronavigation or intraoperative MRI, which are standard practices in modern surgical procedures.\n- There is no mention of any specific measures taken to ensure patient safety and prevent complications, such as infection control protocols or the use of prophylactic antibiotics.\n- The report does not provide information on the post-operative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up instructions.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n- The surgical report should include more specific details about the surgical techniques used, including the specific instruments and equipment employed.\n- It is important to mention the use of intraoperative imaging guidance, such as neuronavigation or intraoperative MRI, to ensure accurate tumor resection and minimize damage to surrounding structures.\n- The report should highlight the implementation of infection control protocols and the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent post-operative complications.\n- Including information on the post-operative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up instructions, is essential for ensuring optimal patient recovery and outcomes.",

Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this. The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding; the skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling.

    "error": "Neuroendoscopic transnasphenoidal approach for pituitary adenoma resection + sellar area exploration",
    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia took effect, the patient was placed in a supine position with the head slightly tilted back. The surgical table was adjusted to a head-high and foot-low position. The surgical field was prepared by disinfecting the nasal cavity and lips with iodine solution and using cotton pads soaked in adrenaline to shrink the nasal mucosa. \n\nThe surgical procedure involved the following steps:\n\n1. Initial exploration: A neuroendoscope was used to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings. The right middle turbinate was pushed laterally, and the sphenoid sinus opening was visualized. The sphenoid sinus opening was then opened using a monopolar electrocautery until the posterior nasal aperture was reached. The bony nasal septum was exposed, and a high-speed drill was used to create a 1.5cm x 1.5cm bone window on the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus. The bone fragment from the lateral wall was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n\n2. Tumor resection: The tumor was visualized on the left side of the pituitary gland, appearing as a soft, gray-white mass with poor vascularity and clear margins. The tumor was completely excised, and a portion of the pituitary gland was also removed. Tissue samples were collected for pathological examination. The tumor cavity was thoroughly irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue was observed. The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater, and the nasal cavity was packed with nasal cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n\n3. Closure: The surgical site was carefully inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and none was found. The artificial dura mater was used to reconstruct the sellar floor. The nasal cavity was packed with nasal cotton to prevent bleeding and infection. The scalp was sutured intermittently and tightly, followed by sequential suturing of the scalp. The wound was covered with sterile dressings.\n\nThe surgery was successful, with a total duration of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml. The patient was extubated and safely transferred back to the anesthesia recovery room. A tumor specimen measuring approximately 5x3x3mm was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on preoperative preparation: The surgical report does not mention the specific preoperative preparations, such as fasting status, preoperative imaging, and laboratory tests. It is important to include these details for a comprehensive surgical report.\n\n2. Incomplete description of intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as neurophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging. These techniques are commonly used in pituitary tumor surgeries to ensure the safety and accuracy of the procedure.\n\n3. Limited information on tumor characteristics: The report does not provide detailed information on the size, location, or histological type of the tumor. This information is crucial for understanding the nature of the tumor and planning further treatment.\n\n4. Lack of postoperative care instructions: The report does not mention any postoperative care instructions given to the patient, such as pain management, wound care, or follow-up appointments. It is important to provide clear instructions to the patient to ensure proper recovery and prevent complications.\n\nOverall, the surgical procedure was performed successfully, but there are areas for improvement in terms of documentation and patient care. It is recommended to include more detailed information in the surgical report and provide comprehensive postoperative care instructions to the patient.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine solution, and cotton soaked with 1ml of adrenaline was used to shrink the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes.\n- The bilateral sphenoid sinus openings were explored using a neuroendoscope, and the right middle turbinate was pushed laterally.\n- The sphenoid sinus opening was then opened using a monopolar electrocautery, extending it to the posterior nasal aperture to expose the bony nasal septum.\n- The sphenoid sinus floor was then drilled using a high-speed drill, enlarging the bone window to 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the sphenoid sinus floor was preserved for later repair.\n- The bony septum within the sphenoid sinus was removed using the drill.\n- The sellar floor bone window was further enlarged using a microdrill to 1.3cm x 1.0cm.\n- The dura mater at the sellar floor was carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing liquefied, gray-white gelatinous tissue within the sella and above it.\n- The tumor tissue within the sella was carefully removed using various sizes of curettes.\n- The sella was irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n- The absence of cerebrospinal fluid leakage was confirmed.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using artificial dura mater.\n- The nasal cavities were packed with cotton and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery lasted for 1 hour, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the tumor characteristics and location: It would be beneficial to provide more specific details about the tumor, such as its size, location, and histopathological diagnosis. This information can help in understanding the extent of the resection and planning further treatment.\n\n2. Inadequate description of intraoperative monitoring: It is important to mention if any intraoperative monitoring techniques were used, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging (MRI or ultrasound). These techniques can help in identifying critical structures and ensuring safe tumor resection.\n\n3. Insufficient information on hemostasis and closure: The report does not provide detailed information on the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery or the closure technique used. It is important to describe the steps taken to achieve hemostasis and the method of closure to ensure proper wound healing.\n\n4. Lack of information on post-operative care: The report does not mention the specific post-operative care provided to the patient, such as pain management, antibiotic prophylaxis, or follow-up plans. Including this information is crucial for comprehensive surgical reporting.\n\n5. Absence of information on complications or adverse events: It is important to mention if any complications or adverse events occurred during the surgery, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage, infection, or bleeding. Reporting these events allows for a more accurate assessment of the surgical outcome and helps in identifying areas for improvement.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more specific information about the tumor, intraoperative monitoring, hemostasis, closure technique, post-operative care, and any complications encountered.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- After the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the left lateral decubitus position, placed on a head frame, and fixed.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this.\n- The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- At this time, the meningeal tension is slightly higher, and dural suspension is performed.\n- After intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, the dura mater was incised radially.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed that there was a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of \u200b\u200bthe temporoparietal area.\n- Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep.\n- The rapid freezing pathology may indicate that it is a high-grade glioma.\n- According to the rough boundary of the tumor, the suction device, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors are used to separate bluntly and sharply, and gradually go deep into the blood vessels.\n- Red, soft and uneven texture, rich blood supply, the size of the resected lesion is about 5cm\u00d76cm\u00d76cm.\n- The triangular area of \u200b\u200bthe lateral ventricle is open.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring showed that the anterior tumor invaded the posterior limb of the internal capsule, so it was not resected.\n- After the tumor was basically removed under the microscope, intraoperative MRI was performed, which showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The peripheral wall of the residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation, and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze to further enhance the hemostatic effect.\n- The systolic blood pressure increased to the entrance blood pressure.\n- It was confirmed that the hemostasis was satisfactory, the brain pulse was good, and there was no foreign body remains.\n- The ventricle and the surgical field are flushed and a drainage tube is placed.\n- The dural resection edge is sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater to keep the dura mater intact.\n- Titanium alloy nail plate is used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly; the scalp was sutured in sequence, covered with sterile dressing, and returned to the ward safely.\n- The bleeding during the operation was about 100ml, no blood transfusion was performed, and the specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. The surgical report lacks specific details about the patient's preoperative condition, such as the symptoms, diagnostic tests, and imaging findings. It is important to include this information to provide a comprehensive understanding of the case.\n\n2. The report does not mention the use of any preoperative antibiotics or prophylactic measures to prevent infection. It is essential to document the administration of antibiotics and other preventive measures to ensure patient safety.\n\n3. The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) or motor evoked potentials (MEPs), to assess the integrity of the neural pathways during the surgery. Intraoperative monitoring can help identify and prevent potential neurological complications.\n\n4. The report does not provide information about the closure technique used for the dural resection edge. It is important to mention whether a watertight closure was achieved and if any additional measures, such as dural sealants, were used to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leakage.\n\n5. The report does not mention the use of any postoperative measures, such as postoperative imaging or follow-up plans. It is crucial to include information about the postoperative care and monitoring to ensure proper recovery and early detection of any complications.\n\n6. The report does not mention the involvement of any other surgical team members, such as an assistant surgeon or scrub nurse. It is important to acknowledge the contributions of the entire surgical team in the report.\n\n7. The report does not provide a clear assessment of the surgical outcome or any postoperative complications. It is essential to document the immediate postoperative condition of the patient and any adverse events that occurred during or after the surgery.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by including more specific information about the surgical technique, intraoperative monitoring, postoperative care, and outcomes.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical bed in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped, with iodine used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips.\n- The nasal mucosa was constricted using cotton pads soaked in a solution containing 1ml of adrenaline for 5 minutes.\n- The surgical team performed a neuroendoscopic exploration of the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings, followed by the use of a monopolar electrocautery to open the sphenoid sinus and expose the bony nasal septum.\n- A high-speed drill was used to create a 1.5cm x 1.5cm bone window in the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, with the bone fragment preserved for later repair.\n- The bone septum was removed using the microdrill, and the sellar floor bone window was enlarged to 1.3cm x 1.0cm using a microhook knife.\n- The tumor was visualized within the sellar region, and careful dissection and removal were performed using various curettes.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution to ensure complete removal of tumor tissue.\n- The surgical site was inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and the sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater.\n- The nasal cavities were packed with nasal tampons and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery lasted for 1.5 hours, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml.\n- The patient was extubated and safely transferred back to the recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Inconsistent positioning: The surgical report mentions that the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, but the standard surgical procedure requires the patient to be in the supine position with the head slightly extended. It is important to ensure accuracy and consistency in reporting the patient's positioning.\n\n2. Lack of details on tumor characteristics: The surgical report does not provide specific information about the tumor, such as its size, location, or histopathological diagnosis. Including these details would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the surgical procedure.\n\n3. Incomplete description of hemostasis: The report briefly mentions the use of scalp clips to stop bleeding, but does not provide further details on the hemostatic measures taken during the procedure. It is important to document the specific techniques and materials used for hemostasis to ensure proper patient care.\n\n4. Limited information on postoperative care: The report does not mention specific postoperative care measures, such as pain management, wound care, or follow-up plans. Including these details would provide a more comprehensive overview of the patient's postoperative management.\n\n5. Lack of documentation on complications: The report does not mention any complications or adverse events that occurred during the surgery. It is important to document any complications encountered and the corresponding actions taken to address them.\n\nOverall, the surgical report demonstrates some inconsistencies and lacks certain important details. To improve the report, it is recommended to provide a more accurate description of the surgical procedure, including tumor characteristics, hemostatic measures, postoperative care, and any complications encountered.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia was completed, the patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical bed in a head-up, feet-down position. The surgical field was prepared and draped, with the nasal cavity and lips disinfected using iodine solution. Cotton pads soaked in 1ml of adrenaline were applied to the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes to shrink the nasal turbinates. \n\nThe surgical team then proceeded with the surgical plan, starting with the use of a neuroendoscope to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings. The right middle turbinate was pushed laterally, and the sphenoid sinus opening was accessed using a monopolar electrocautery. The opening was extended to the posterior nasal aperture, exposing the bony nasal septum. A high-speed drill was used to remove the bony wall of the sphenoid sinus, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The removed bone fragment was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor defect. \n\nUpon further exploration, a bony septum was identified within the sphenoid sinus and was removed using the drill. The sellar floor bone window was then enlarged to 1.3cm x 1.0cm using a microdrill. Careful dissection with a microhook knife allowed access to the tumor tissue, which appeared as a soft, gray-white mass within the sellar and suprasellar regions. The tumor was well-defined, without a capsule, and did not invade the bilateral cavernous sinuses or the sellar septum. The tumor was completely resected, and tissue samples were collected for pathological examination. The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline, and no residual tumor tissue was observed. \n\nThe surgical site was thoroughly inspected, and no cerebrospinal fluid leakage was detected. The sellar floor defect was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. Both nasal cavities were packed with nasal tampons soaked in saline, and sterile dressings were applied. The surgery proceeded smoothly, with a total surgical time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. The resected tumor measured approximately 22\u00d720\u00d714mm\u00b3.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation regarding the use of neuronavigation and intraoperative ultrasound for tumor localization and assessment.\n2. Inadequate description of the tumor characteristics, such as its consistency, vascularity, and proximity to critical structures.\n3. Insufficient information on the extent of tumor resection and the need for intraoperative MRI to assess the completeness of resection.\n4. Limited discussion on the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery and the need for postoperative drainage.\n5. Lack of information on the closure technique used for the dural resection edge and the type of artificial dura mater used for reconstruction.\n6. Incomplete documentation of the closure technique for the galea aponeurosis and scalp.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Provide more detailed information on the use of neuronavigation and intraoperative ultrasound, including the specific techniques used and their role in tumor localization and assessment.\n2. Describe the tumor characteristics in more detail, including its consistency, vascularity, and proximity to critical structures, as this information is important for surgical planning and prognosis.\n3. Clearly document the extent of tumor resection and the use of intraoperative MRI to assess the completeness of resection, as this information is crucial for postoperative management and follow-up.\n4. Provide a comprehensive description of the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery, including the use of bipolar electrocoagulation, gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n5. Describe the closure technique used for the dural resection edge, including the type of suture material and the method of suturing, as well as the type of artificial dura mater used for reconstruction.\n6. Provide a detailed description of the closure technique for the galea aponeurosis and scalp, including the type of suture material and the method of suturing, to ensure proper wound closure and healing.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more comprehensive information on the surgical techniques used and the postoperative management.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is prepared and draped using standard sterile techniques. The nasal cavity and lips are disinfected with iodine solution, and cotton pads soaked in 1ml of epinephrine are applied to the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes to achieve vasoconstriction. \n\nThe surgeon performs a neuroendoscopic exploration of the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings, pushing the right middle turbinate laterally with a monopolar electrocautery. The sphenoid sinus opening is then incised using a monopolar electrocautery until the posterior nasal aperture is reached, exposing the bony nasal septum. \n\nA high-speed drill is used to remove the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The removed bone fragment from the lateral wall of the sphenoid sinus is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor defect. The intrasphenoidal septum is also removed using the high-speed drill. \n\nUnder microscopic guidance, the sellar floor bone window is further enlarged to 1.3cm x 1.0cm using a microdrill. The surgeon carefully incises the sellar dura mater using a microhook knife, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue on the right side of the pituitary gland. The tumor is well-defined, without a pseudocapsule. The medial walls of the cavernous sinuses are intact, as well as the sellar septum. The tumor is completely resected, with partial resection of the surrounding pituitary tissue. Tissue samples are taken for pathological examination using various sizes of curettes. \n\nThe tumor cavity is irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue is observed. The surgical field is thoroughly inspected, and there is no cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater. The nasal cavities are packed with nasal tampons soaked in saline solution, and sterile dressings are applied. \n\nThe surgery proceeds smoothly, with a total surgical time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A tumor specimen measuring approximately 8x6x5mm^3 is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Inconsistent positioning: The patient should be placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended, not in the left lateral decubitus position. This ensures proper access and visualization during the surgery.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical approach: The surgical approach should be described in more detail, including the use of neuronavigation and the specific incision made for accessing the tumor.\n\n3. Lack of information on intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring, to ensure the safety of critical structures during tumor resection.\n\n4. Insufficient documentation of tumor characteristics: The report should provide more information about the tumor, such as its location, size, and histopathological features, to aid in accurate diagnosis and postoperative management.\n\n5. Incomplete description of hemostasis: The report should specify the techniques used for hemostasis, such as bipolar electrocoagulation, and provide details on the use of gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n\n6. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report should include details on postoperative care, such as the use of a drainage tube and any specific instructions for wound care and follow-up.\n\nOverall, the surgical report has several inconsistencies and lacks important details. It is important to provide a comprehensive and accurate report to ensure proper documentation and communication among the surgical team.",

The nasal septum was restored to its normal anatomical position, and nasal cotton was placed in both nasal cavities and covered with sterile dressings.\n\n- The surgery was successful, with a total duration of 1 hour and minimal blood loss. The patient was extubated and transferred to the anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation: The surgical report lacks specific details regarding the size and location of the tumor, as well as the extent of resection. It is important to provide accurate measurements and descriptions to ensure comprehensive documentation.\n\n2. Inadequate description of intraoperative monitoring: The report does not mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or neuronavigation. These techniques are important for ensuring the safety and accuracy of the surgery and should be included in the report.\n\n3. Limited information on post-operative care: The report does not provide information on the post-operative care plan, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up instructions. It is essential to include these details to ensure proper post-operative management.\n\n4. Lack of discussion on potential complications: The report does not mention any potential complications that may arise from the surgery, such as cerebrospinal fluid leakage or infection. It is important to address these potential risks and provide recommendations for their prevention and management.\n\n5. Incomplete description of hemostasis: The report does not provide specific details on the hemostatic techniques used during the surgery. It is important to describe the methods used to achieve hemostasis and ensure adequate control of bleeding.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and should be revised to provide a more comprehensive and accurate account of the surgery. It is important to ensure that all relevant information is included to facilitate proper documentation and communication among the surgical team.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame after anesthesia.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galea aponeurosis were incised in sequence.\n- Scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially after intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal region.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm x 6cm x 6cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n\n- The surgical report lacks information on the specific type of tumor and its location.\n- There is no mention of the extent of the tumor resection and whether any residual tumor was left.\n- The report does not provide details on the closure of the dural resection edge and the technique used for artificial dura mater placement.\n- The amount of bleeding during the operation is mentioned but not evaluated in terms of its impact on the patient's condition.\n- There is no mention of any complications or adverse events that occurred during the surgery.\n- The report does not provide information on the postoperative care plan for the patient.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n- Include specific details about the tumor type, location, and extent of resection in the surgical report.\n- Provide information on the closure technique used for the dural resection edge and the placement of artificial dura mater.\n- Evaluate the amount of bleeding during the operation in terms of its impact on the patient's condition.\n- Include any complications or adverse events that occurred during the surgery in the report.\n- Provide a detailed postoperative care plan for the patient, including pain management, wound care, and follow-up appointments.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical bed in a head-up, feet-down position.\n- The surgical field was prepared and draped, with iodine used to disinfect the nasal cavity and lips.\n- Nasal cotton soaked with 1ml of adrenaline was placed to shrink the nasal mucosa.\n- A neuroendoscope was used to explore the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings and push the middle turbinate laterally.\n- A monopolar electrocautery was used to open the sphenoid sinus opening and expose the bony nasal septum.\n- A high-speed drill was used to enlarge the sphenoid sinus and create a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm.\n- The bone fragment from the sphenoid sinus was preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n- The bone septum within the sphenoid sinus was removed using the drill.\n- A microscope was used to further enlarge the sellar floor bone window to 1.3cm x 1.0cm.\n- A microhook knife was used to carefully incise the dura mater at the sellar floor, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor with clear boundaries and intact pseudocapsule.\n- The tumor was completely resected, with partial resection of the surrounding pituitary tissue.\n- Tumor specimens were collected for pathological examination.\n- The sellar cavity was irrigated with saline and no residual tumor tissue was observed.\n- The dura mater was repaired using an artificial dura mater (Rui Mo) and hydroxyapatite for sellar floor reconstruction.\n- Nasal cotton was placed in both nasal cavities and covered with sterile dressings.\n- The surgery lasted for 1 hour, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the patient's preoperative condition, such as the reason for the surgery and any relevant medical history. It is important to include this information in the surgical report for a comprehensive understanding of the case.\n\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical approach and technique used. The report should provide more specific details on the surgical incision, tissue dissection, and tumor resection methods employed.\n\n3. Absence of information on intraoperative monitoring and assessment of vital signs. It is crucial to document the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and other relevant parameters during the surgery.\n\n4. Limited information on postoperative care and follow-up plans. The report should mention the postoperative instructions given to the patient, including pain management, wound care, and scheduled follow-up appointments.\n\n5. Lack of information on the final pathological diagnosis and any additional findings from the specimen examination. Including this information would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the surgical outcome.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks sufficient detail and organization. It is important to provide a more comprehensive and standardized report that includes all relevant information about the surgical procedure, patient condition, and postoperative care.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia is completed, the patient is placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended. The surgical field is prepared and draped, ensuring proper sterilization. The nasal cavity and lips are disinfected with iodine solution, and nasal cotton soaked with 1ml of epinephrine is used to shrink the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes. \n\nThe surgeon performs neuroendoscopic exploration of the bilateral sphenoid sinus openings, pushing the right middle turbinate laterally. The sphenoid sinus opening is then opened using a monopolar electrocautery, extending the incision to the posterior nasal aperture. This exposes the bony nasal septum, which is further enlarged using a high-speed drill to create a 1.5cm X 1.5cm bone window on the ventral wall of the sphenoid sinus. The bone fragment from the ventral wall is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor.\n\nThe surgeon removes the bony septum within the sphenoid sinus using the drill. A microdrill is then used to further enlarge the sellar floor window to 1.3cm X 1.0cm. Careful dissection with a microhook knife allows access to the pituitary gland, where a soft, grayish-white tumor with limited blood supply is observed. The tumor is clearly identified, with partial pseudocapsule. The medial walls of the cavernous sinuses are intact, as well as the sellar septum. The tumor is completely resected, with partial resection of the surrounding pituitary tissue. Tissue samples are taken for pathological examination.\n\nThe tumor cavity is irrigated with saline solution, ensuring no residual tumor tissue is present. The surgical site is carefully inspected for any cerebrospinal fluid leakage, and artificial dura mater and hydroxyapatite are used to reconstruct the sellar floor. Nasal cotton is packed into both nasal cavities and covered with sterile dressings.\n\nThe surgery proceeds smoothly, with a total surgical time of 1 hour and an estimated blood loss of approximately 50ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room. A tumor specimen measuring approximately 6mm X 5mm X 5mm is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n\n1. Lack of detailed documentation of the surgical approach and technique used.\n2. Inadequate description of the tumor characteristics and location.\n3. Insufficient information on the extent of tumor resection and the need for further treatment.\n4. Failure to mention the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or neuronavigation.\n5. Lack of information on post-operative care, including pain management and wound care instructions.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n1. Provide a more detailed description of the surgical approach, including the specific incisions made and the instruments used.\n2. Clearly describe the tumor characteristics, such as size, consistency, and vascularity, as well as its relationship to surrounding structures.\n3. Specify the extent of tumor resection and whether any residual tumor remains.\n4. Include information on the use of intraoperative monitoring techniques to ensure the safety of critical structures.\n5. Provide detailed post-operative care instructions, including pain management and wound care protocols.\n\nOverall, the surgical report provided lacks sufficient detail and clarity in describing the surgical procedure. It is important to provide a comprehensive and accurate account of the surgery to ensure proper documentation and communication among the surgical team.",

Nasal cotton soaked with 1ml of adrenaline is used to shrink the nasal mucosa for 5 minutes. The bilateral sphenoid sinus openings are explored using a neuroendoscope. The right middle turbinate is pushed laterally, and the sphenoid sinus opening is opened using a monopolar electrocautery. The opening is extended to the posterior nasal aperture, exposing the bony nasal septum. The sphenoid sinus floor is then drilled using a high-speed drill, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The bone fragment from the sphenoid sinus floor is preserved for later repair of the sellar floor. The bony septum inside the sphenoid sinus is removed using a microdrill. The sellar floor bone window is further enlarged to 1.3cm x 1.0cm using a microdrill. The dura mater of the sellar floor is carefully incised using a microhook knife, revealing a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue in the central part of the pituitary gland. The tumor appears to have poor blood supply and no pseudocapsule. The medial walls of the bilateral cavernous sinuses are intact, as well as the sellar septum. The tumor is completely resected, with partial resection of the surrounding pituitary tissue. Tissue samples are taken for pathological examination. The tumor cavity is irrigated with saline and no residual tumor tissue is observed. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage is absent. The sellar floor is reconstructed using an artificial dura mater and hydroxyapatite. Nasal cotton is placed in both nasal cavities and covered with sterile dressings. The surgery proceeds smoothly, with a total surgical time of 1.5 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient is extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia recovery room. A tumor specimen measuring approximately 3x3x4mm^3 is sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings of the operation:\n1. Lack of detailed information on the positioning and fixation of the patient.\n2. Inadequate description of the surgical field preparation and draping.\n3. Insufficient explanation of the steps taken to ensure hemostasis during the procedure.\n4. Limited information on the use of intraoperative imaging techniques, such as neuronavigation and ultrasound.\n5. Lack of details on the closure of the surgical site, including the suturing technique used and the type of sterile dressings applied.\n6. Incomplete documentation of the patient's vital signs and post-operative recovery process.\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Provide a more detailed description of the patient's positioning and the use of head frames or other devices for fixation.\n2. Include specific details on the sterilization process and the placement of drapes to ensure a sterile surgical field.\n3. Elaborate on the methods used to achieve hemostasis, such as the use of electrocautery or hemostatic agents.\n4. Describe the utilization of intraoperative imaging techniques and their role in guiding the surgical procedure.\n5. Provide a comprehensive account of the closure of the surgical site, including the suturing technique and the application of sterile dressings.\n6. Document the patient's vital signs throughout the surgery and provide information on their post-operative recovery, including pain management and monitoring for complications.\n\nOverall Grade: B",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\nAfter the anesthesia was completed, the patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical bed in a head-up, feet-down position. The surgical field was prepared by disinfecting the nasal cavity, lips, and left lateral thigh with iodine solution. \n\nA skin incision was made on the left lateral thigh, and approximately 2cm x 3cm autologous fat was harvested and stored for later use. The incision was then closed layer by layer. \n\nNasal decongestion was achieved by applying a cotton pad soaked in 1ml of adrenaline solution to the posterior part of the nasal turbinate for 5 minutes. The right nasal turbinate was gently pushed laterally to create space for the surgical access. \n\nUsing a high-speed drill, the sphenoid sinus medial wall was enlarged, creating a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm. The tumor tissue and scar tissue within the sphenoid sinus were removed. \n\nThe sellar floor bone window was further enlarged using a microdrill to a size of 1.3cm x 1.0cm. Careful dissection of the sellar floor dura mater revealed a soft, grayish-white tumor tissue in the left wing of the pituitary gland. The tumor appeared to have a poor blood supply and lacked a pseudocapsule. The pituitary gland was also visible and appeared yellow in color. \n\nThe medial walls of the cavernous sinuses were intact, and the sellar septum was intact. The tumor was completely resected, and tissue samples were collected for pathological examination using various sizes of curettes. The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline solution, and no residual tumor tissue was observed. \n\nCareful inspection revealed no cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The sellar floor was reconstructed using artificial dura mater, autologous fat, and fascial tissue. Nasal cotton was packed bilaterally and covered with sterile dressings. \n\nThe surgery proceeded smoothly, with a total surgical time of 3 hours and an estimated blood loss of approximately 100ml. The patient was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit. A portion of the resected tumor measuring approximately 3mm x 3mm x 3mm was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Inconsistent patient positioning: The surgical report mentions that the patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position, but the standard surgical procedure requires the patient to be in the supine position with the head slightly extended. It is important to ensure accurate and consistent patient positioning to facilitate the surgical access and minimize complications. \n\nSuggestion: Ensure that the patient is positioned correctly according to the standard surgical procedure.\n\n2. Inadequate description of tumor characteristics: The surgical report lacks detailed information about the tumor, such as its location, size, and histopathological diagnosis. This information is crucial for proper documentation and future reference.\n\nSuggestion: Include a comprehensive description of the tumor, including its location, size, and histopathological diagnosis.\n\n3. Lack of information about intraoperative monitoring: The surgical report does not mention any intraoperative monitoring techniques used during the procedure. Intraoperative monitoring, such as electrophysiological monitoring, can help identify critical structures and minimize the risk of neurological complications.\n\nSuggestion: Include information about the intraoperative monitoring techniques used, such as electrophysiological monitoring.\n\n4. Incomplete description of hemostasis and closure: The surgical report does not provide detailed information about the hemostasis techniques used or the closure of the surgical site. Proper hemostasis and closure are essential to prevent postoperative bleeding and infection.\n\nSuggestion: Include a detailed description of the hemostasis techniques used and the closure of the surgical site.\n\n5. Lack of information about postoperative care: The surgical report does not mention any postoperative care measures taken or any postoperative complications observed. Postoperative care is crucial for the patient's recovery and should be documented.\n\nSuggestion: Include information about the postoperative care measures taken and any postoperative complications observed.\n\nOverall, the surgical report has several inconsistencies and lacks important details. It is important to ensure accurate and comprehensive documentation of the surgical procedure to facilitate communication, future reference, and quality improvement.",

Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface, and a right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on this. The surgical field is sterilized and draped as usual; the scalp, subcutaneous, and galeal aponeurosis are incised in sequence, and scalp clips are used to stop bleeding; the skin flap is separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward, and the milling cutter is used to cut the bone plate after drilling. At this time, the meningeal tension is slightly higher, and dural suspension is performed. After intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation, the dura mater was incised radially. Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed that there was a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of \u200b\u200bthe temporoparietal area. Under the guidance of navigation and ultrasound, dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep. The rapid freezing pathology may indicate that it is a high-grade glioma.

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the supine position with the head slightly extended and the surgical table tilted with the head elevated and feet lowered.\n- After successful navigation registration, the surgical field was prepared and draped, and the nasal cavity and lips were disinfected with iodine.\n- The middle nasal turbinate on the right side was pushed outward, and the sphenoid sinus opening was accessed using a monopolar electrocautery.\n- The sphenoid sinus opening was extended to the posterior nasal cavity, exposing the bony nasal septum.\n- The left middle nasal turbinate was removed, and the sphenoid sinus floor was drilled using a high-speed drill to create a bone window measuring 1.5cm x 1.5cm.\n- The bone window from the sphenoid sinus floor was preserved for later repair.\n- The bony septum at the sellar floor was carefully opened using a microdrill, and the tumor was visualized in the sellar and suprasellar region.\n- The tumor was partially resected using microdissection techniques, and tumor specimens were collected for pathological examination.\n- The tumor cavity was irrigated with saline to ensure no residual tumor tissue was left.\n- The dura mater at the sellar floor was intact, and no cerebrospinal fluid leakage was observed.\n- The sellar floor was reconstructed using an artificial dura mater.\n- Nasal packing with sterile gauze was performed to prevent postoperative bleeding.\n- The surgery lasted for 4 hours, with an estimated blood loss of approximately 400ml.\n- The patient was extubated and transferred to the recovery room.\n- The tumor size was approximately 33mm x 36mm x 28mm, and a partial specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on the anesthesia process: The surgical report should include information on the type of anesthesia used, the patient's vital signs during the procedure, and any complications or challenges encountered during anesthesia. This information is important for evaluating the overall safety and success of the surgery.\n\n2. Incomplete description of tumor characteristics: The report should provide more detailed information about the tumor, such as its location within the sellar and suprasellar region, its consistency, and any specific features observed during the surgery. This information can help in determining the nature of the tumor and planning further treatment.\n\n3. Inadequate documentation of intraoperative monitoring: The report should mention the use of any intraoperative monitoring techniques, such as electrophysiological monitoring or intraoperative imaging, and their findings. This information is crucial for assessing the accuracy of tumor resection and minimizing the risk of damage to surrounding structures.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report should include details about the postoperative care provided to the patient, such as pain management, wound care, and plans for follow-up imaging or laboratory tests. This information is essential for ensuring proper recovery and monitoring for any postoperative complications.\n\n5. Insufficient documentation of hemostasis: The report should provide more information on the hemostatic measures taken during the surgery, such as the use of bipolar electrocoagulation or hemostatic agents. This information is important for evaluating the effectiveness of hemostasis and preventing postoperative bleeding.\n\n6. Absence of information on the closure of the surgical site: The report should describe the closure technique used for the nasal cavity and scalp incisions, including the type of sutures or closure materials used. This information is necessary for assessing the adequacy of wound closure and minimizing the risk of infection.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and should be more comprehensive in documenting the surgical process, intraoperative findings, and postoperative care. Providing a more detailed and standardized report will improve the quality of documentation and facilitate better communication among healthcare providers.",

    "surgery_review": "Surgery Process: \n\n- The patient was placed in the left lateral decubitus position and fixed on a head frame.\n- Neuronavigation registration was used to outline the projection of the tumor on the body surface.\n- A right temporo-parieto-occipital horseshoe incision was designed based on the tumor projection.\n- The surgical field was sterilized and draped.\n- The scalp, subcutaneous tissue, and galeal aponeurosis were incised, and scalp clips were used to stop bleeding.\n- The skin flap was separated under the galea aponeurosis and turned downward.\n- The milling cutter was used to cut the bone plate after drilling.\n- Dural suspension was performed to relieve meningeal tension.\n- The dura mater was incised radially under the guidance of intraoperative ultrasound and neuronavigation.\n- Electrophysiological monitoring confirmed the presence of a cortical fistula in the non-functional area of the temporoparietal area.\n- Dark red tumor tissue was visible about 2cm deep, and it was determined to be a high-grade glioma based on rapid freezing pathology.\n- The tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors.\n- The resected lesion measured approximately 5cm x 6cm x 6cm.\n- The triangular area of the lateral ventricle was open.\n- Intraoperative MRI showed subtotal resection of the lesion.\n- The residual cavity was carefully stopped with bipolar electrocoagulation and covered with gelatin sponge, collagen surgical hemostatic material, and instant gauze.\n- Hemostasis was confirmed to be satisfactory.\n- The ventricle and surgical field were flushed, and a drainage tube was placed.\n- The dural resection edge was sutured intermittently and covered with artificial dura mater.\n- A titanium alloy nail plate was used for free bone plate reduction.\n- The galea aponeurosis was sutured intermittently and tightly.\n- The scalp was sutured in sequence and covered with sterile dressing.\n- The patient was safely returned to the ward.\n- The bleeding during the operation was approximately 100ml, and no blood transfusion was performed.\n- The specimen was sent for pathological examination.\n\nShortcomings and Suggestions:\n\n1. Lack of detailed information on anesthesia: The surgical report does not provide specific details about the anesthesia used during the procedure. It is important to include information about the type of anesthesia, any complications or challenges encountered, and the patient's response to anesthesia.\n\n2. Incomplete description of tumor characteristics: The report mentions that the tumor was dark red, soft, and had an uneven texture, but it does not provide further details about its location, size, or any specific features observed during the surgery. Including these details would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the tumor.\n\n3. Limited information on tumor resection: The report states that the tumor was resected using suction devices, bipolar electrocoagulation, and scissors, but it does not describe the technique used or any challenges encountered during the resection. Providing more information on the surgical approach and any difficulties faced would enhance the report.\n\n4. Lack of information on postoperative care: The report does not mention the postoperative care provided to the patient, such as pain management, monitoring, or any specific instructions given. Including this information would ensure a more comprehensive report.\n\n5. Inadequate documentation of complications: The report does not mention any complications encountered during the surgery or any measures taken to address them. It is important to document any complications, such as bleeding, infection, or damage to surrounding structures, and describe the steps taken to manage them.\n\n6. Insufficient details on specimen handling: The report briefly mentions that the specimen was sent for pathological examination, but it does not provide information on how the specimen was handled, labeled, or transported. Including these details would ensure proper documentation of specimen management.\n\n7. Lack of information on surgical team members: The report does not mention the names or roles of the surgical team members involved in the procedure. It is important to acknowledge the contributions of all team members and provide a clear understanding of their roles.\n\nOverall, the surgical report lacks some important details and could be improved by providing more comprehensive information on anesthesia, tumor characteristics, resection technique, postoperative care, complications, specimen handling, and surgical team members.",

Resection of the pituitary adenoma\n5. Reconstruction of the sellar floor\n6. Closure of the nasal cavity and skin incision\n\nPrecautions:\n1. Careful dissection of the tumor to avoid damage to the surrounding brain tissue and blood vessels\n2. Monitoring of the optic nerve and chiasm during the surgery to avoid compression or injury\n3. Control of bleeding during the surgery\n4. Preservation of the pituitary stalk and surrounding normal pituitary tissue\n5. Reconstruction of the sellar floor to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak\n```\n\nNote: The surgery method chosen is based on the tumor location, size, and compression on the optic chiasm, which requires a minimally invasive approach to avoid damage to the surrounding brain tissue and blood vessels. The neuroendoscopic transnasosphenoidal approach is a suitable option for this case, and the sellar floor reconstruction is necessary to prevent cerebrospinal fluid leak.",
