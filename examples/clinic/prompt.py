your plan:

1. Pre-Operative Assessment:
   - Review the patient's medical history, including the MRI results indicating a space-occupying lesion of the tuberculum sellae and meningioma.
   - Conduct a thorough neurological examination to assess any changes since the last evaluation.
   - Perform a pre-operative ophthalmologic evaluation to document the extent of visual impairment.
   - Order pre-operative blood tests to check for any coagulation disorders or other systemic issues.
   - Schedule a pre-operative meeting with the anesthesiology team to discuss anesthesia management, considering the patient's age and medical history.
   - Counsel the patient about the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of the surgery.

2. Surgical Team Roles:
   - SurgeryDoctor: Will lead the surgery, perform the tumor resection, and manage any intraoperative complications.
   - Nurse: Will assist with patient preparation, manage surgical instruments, and monitor the patient's vitals during the procedure.

3. Operating Room Preparation:
   - Ensure that all necessary surgical instruments for a cranial procedure are available and sterilized.
   - Prepare the anesthesia equipment and medications.
   - Set up the neuro-navigation system to assist with precise tumor localization during surgery.
   - Arrange for intraoperative monitoring equipment, including evoked potentials, to monitor the patient's neurological status.

4. Anesthesia and Positioning:
   - Induce general anesthesia following the anesthesiology team's plan.
   - Position the patient to provide optimal access to the tuberculum sellae region while ensuring the patient's safety and comfort.

5. Surgical Procedure:
   - Perform a craniotomy to access the tumor.
   - Use microsurgical techniques and the neuro-navigation system to carefully resect the tumor while preserving surrounding neural structures.
   - Monitor the patient's neurological status throughout the procedure using intraoperative monitoring.
   - Obtain intraoperative frozen sections to confirm the removal of tumor tissue.
   - Close the surgical site meticulously to minimize the risk of infection and promote healing.

6. Post-Operative Care:
   - Transfer the patient to the recovery room and monitor vitals until stable.
   - Once stable, move the patient to the neurosurgical intensive care unit for close observation.
   - Schedule a post-operative MRI to assess the extent of tumor resection.
   - Monitor for any signs of complications, such as bleeding, infection, or changes in neurological status.
   - Begin post-operative medications, including pain management and any necessary steroids to reduce swelling.
   - Plan for post-operative ophthalmologic evaluation to assess any changes in visual function.
   - Arrange for a follow-up appointment with the neurosurgery team to discuss the pathology results and any further treatment if necessary.

7. Rehabilitation:
   - Refer the patient to a rehabilitation specialist to address any residual neurological deficits.
   - Provide visual rehabilitation services to help the patient adapt to any remaining visual impairment.

8. Follow-Up:
   - Schedule regular follow-up visits to monitor the patient's recovery and to detect any signs of tumor recurrence early.
   - Continue to monitor the patient's visual and neurological status over time.

        Medical history: The patient is a 56-year-old female. Due to decreased vision in both eyes for 1 year, 
    she visited the ophthalmology department of many hospitals, but the treatment effect was poor; 6 months ago, 
    the patient underwent a cranial MRI in another hospital, which showed space-occupying lesions of the tuberculum sellae and meningioma. 
    possible? The patient was transferred to the neurosurgery department of our hospital for treatment. 
    Physical examination: clear mind, bilateral pupils of equal sizes and circles, 2.5 mm in diameter, 
    bilateral pupils with sensitive direct and indirect light reflections, rough visual acuity measurement of both eyes, 
    counting fingers in meters in the left eye, counting fingers in front of the right eye, Temporal hemianopsia, 
    no limitation of eye movement, normal limb muscle strength, low muscle tone, physiological reflexes, but no pathological reflexes.
